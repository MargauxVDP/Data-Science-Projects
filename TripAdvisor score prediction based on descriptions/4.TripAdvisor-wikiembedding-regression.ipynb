      "[\"No Hyatt Touch Small Pool Heart of Congestion Hello if you are headed here you are headed to the only Waikiki hotel this end with two jacuzzis ! Now don ; t run over from Starwood acroos the street or they will run you away ! The pool however is no bigger than a standard pool table at your favorite arcade ! Speaking of fun get ready to play the same game you do with the local supermarket in their Gold Passport program ! See they give you a three page folio for a Three day stay with all these extra charge for in room coffee @ $ 1.38 USD per cup ! and a $ 20.00 breakfast buffet per person and a 3.50 safe charge and on and on . Don ; t expect a concierge or knowledgeable staff they have retreated to the Expedia Fun ! desk now if you are internet savvy you can save on activity by going to expedia.com but there is no one but Tommy at the desk that can explain the activity in detail to you . The staff look to economize and take short cut when ever possible . There is NO private beach ! The fitness center is at a charge unless it is waived with Gold Passport membership and like Safeway supermarket you saved a whooping XXXX . Wow ! I suggest using those Gold Passport point on Kauai not here . The carpet in the Diamond Head Tower headed for an April renovation is in shabbles and the room feature television that DONOT EVEN FACE THE BED ! The shop are over priced a for the health spa make and keep an exact appointment . This is not a business hotel ! Try the Marriott down the street . Oh for internet access there are a limited 6 slot available for the wireless service if you sit directly in front of the coffee shop ! The wireless anywhere else doe not work and truely doe not exist , le than 100 room in the hotel ( the twin tower ! ) have high speed internet . Now for the High twin tower -- yep a the wind rip thru each evening your balcony door on floor 10 and higher will shake rattle and roll and then the siren start the police station is across the street . This hotel wa the killer for my Hyatt Touch -- I have moved on to Hilton Hawaiian Village , Marriott and Outrigger ! It is not a RESORT ! It ha lost it 's touch and Hyatt ha lost my favor !\", \"I 'm in love with this hotel , the best experience ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I could not have asked for a better hotel , staff , service or anything else . The Westin is the classiest hotel I have ever stayed in , I would choose this hotel over the Plaza . The location is amazing , the staff especially Chris who work the night shift is amazing , we were stuck without a place to stay and he accomodated u at 12:00 a.m. and took care of everything we needed for the rest of this trip . I will stay at the Westin on every trip I go on in the future in any city especially NYC .\", \"A perfect haven in a manic city ... We stayed at The Library for 4 night over Christmas and it could n't have been better.All the previous review were spot on - the room are good sized and well equipped for New York standard , the breakfast very good , the wine and cheese in the evening excellent and the staff ... well ... quite exceptional , and possibly the best staff anywhere we 've stayed . They helped organise our Christmas Day dinner at the River Cafe in Brooklyn , and we could n't have been more pleased . If you ever need a romantic dinner in New York , check it out ... ! The location of the hotel is great too and you do n't feel like you walk too far to get to all the major attraction ( Times Square , 5th Avenue , Macy 's etc . ) and with Grand Central 2 block away , commuting around Manhattan is a breeze.All in all I ca n't recommend this hotel enough and if we ever return , we will definitely stay here again .\", 'Miami nice - Oct03 Went to RIU Florida Beach for 10 Days in October 2003.The room and staff were great , a slightly over priced mini bar but plenty of shop nearby made it easier.Loved hanging in the hammock and strolling to the beach , which the hotel back on to.Not much nightlife near hotel , either need to walk/cab to South Beach or go to local Outback Steak House.The Restaurant wa a bit tacky but the entertainment at the cocktail bar made up for it.Rooms cleaned daily , with the towel being arranged like sea creature and choclate kiss being left under your pillow.Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a great relaxing clean hotel .', \"Nice central hotel that is good value We stayed at the Stamford Hillview during a stop-over on the way Europe for 1 night on the way there and back home to Australia . Great location , right off the central shopping area and near the subway . Very well airconditioned which is a must in Hong Kong ! Our room wa average with no view and the bathroom wa very clean . Be wary of the hill though , it is certainly on top of a VERY STEEP hill ! The shuttle bus from the airport wo n't go up the hill , and taxi driver do n't either so be prepared for a steep climb . Otherwise you can access the hotel via the auto garage at the bottom of the hill however there are n't any sign so I assume the hotel doe n't like people using this route . Staff were prompt and friendly and very willing to help point out nearby attraction and eateries.Good value for money , great location , I would stay there again !\", \"Good value for money , fantastic location ! I stayed at the hotel for 4 night while I atteneded a congress in Frankfurt . The location wa great , a it wa le than 5 min by foot from the contral train station . I walked to the exhibition center everyday , a it wa just 15 min away . It wa one stop away from the main shopping street ( i think it wa called Zeil ) . I loved the breakfast , although they did n't serve a massive variety , all food were very tasty - the sausage , bread , egg and homemade yoghurt , which I loved most . The staff were always friendly and helpful . The room wa very basic but spotless , super clean and warm ( I went there in winter ) . I enjoyed Frankfurt very much partly becoz I had great sleep every night . I will go back to the same hotel again !\", \"A real find in Boston I stayed at the Lenox when my conference hotel wa full and I needed a place close by . If you ask me , it wa the best bit of luck I 've had in a while.Like you 'll read in other review , the lobby is a step back in time to when city hotel were something to behold . I found the staff to be both pleasant and efficient , and quite willing to help out whenever it wa necessary.My room wa pretty spacious for an old , downtown hotel : The bathroom had been updated recently , and although it did n't work ( probably a good thing ) , the fireplace in the center made for a pretty swanky hotel experience.If you 're a sucker for quality skin and bath product , you 're going to love what the Lenox ha to offer . The Aveda shampoo , lotion , conditioner , etc. , got taken away from me a soon a I got back home and although my wife smelled great for week , I did n't get a chance to use them myself.I know a couple of the review spoke critically of the Irish bar and restaurant in the hotel but I would n't take them too seriously . Indeed , the other restaurant ( Azure ) is head and shoulder above Solas ( the Irish pub ) , and in a town like Boston , there 's a million more authentic Irish bar . However , I had a very respectable hanger steak and Guinness at 11 at night when my flight wa delayed and I found the atmosphere warm and filled with local . I think I wa the only person from the hotel there ! Upon checking out , I picked up a business card at the front desk . On the back wa written , The Lenox Hotel . My address in Boston with a line to fill in your name . I picked up a handful of card and plan on making this a reality from now on.Highly recommended .\", 'It is perfect This hotel is amazing ! No need to write the same thing you will find in the other review . I will just touch on the internet service which I found to be excellent . I am not a person that need to be connected 24/7 but I needed to double check couple of flight reservation and any e-mail from my professor . Let me tell you that finding an Internet station in Venice is not that easy at all . So I wa very pleasantly surprise to be able to use the lobby computer on the second floor for free . Great hotel , great service and perfect location !', 'It is what it is ... .. Sunrise at Parador Villas del Mar']\n"

See they give you a three page for a Three day stay with all these extra charge for in room coffee @ $ USD per cup ! and a $ 20.00 breakfast buffet per person and a 3.50 safe charge and on and on . Don ; t expect a concierge or knowledgeable staff they have to the Expedia Fun ! desk now if you are internet you can save on activity by going to but there is no one but at the desk that can explain the activity in detail to you . The staff look to and take short cut when ever possible . There is NO private beach ! The fitness center is at a charge unless it is with Gold membership and like Safeway supermarket you saved a . Wow ! I suggest using those Gold point on Kauai not here . The carpet in the Diamond Head Tower headed for an April renovation is in and the room feature television that THE BED ! The shop are over priced a for the health spa make and keep an exact appointment . This is not a business hotel ! Try the Marriott down the street .

      " Review:  It is perfect This hotel is amazing ! No need to write the same thing you will find in the other review . I will just touch on the internet service which I found to be excellent . I am not a person that need to be connected 24/7 but I needed to double check couple of flight reservation and any e-mail from my . Let me tell you that finding an Internet station in Venice is not that easy at all . So I wa very pleasantly surprise to be able to use the lobby computer on the second floor for free . Great hotel , great service and perfect location ! \n",

      " Review:  Overall positive experience Stayed one night , Saturday , two room . My wife and 4 kid ranging from in age . Quick , efficient check-in process . Decent ( average to slightly above ) size room . Bathroom is much larger than what you 'd usually find at this . Quiet . Comfy bed a advertised . $ per room ( each w/ two double bed ) with all fee , tax , etc.We did not eat in the hotel . The Red Flame Diner is o.k . - but it is JUST a diner , so beware of all the positive review , especially if you 're from NY or an area where they 're are lot 's of location - close enough to Times Square - yet far enough away , if you know what I usually stay at the Excelsior on the . I 'd rate this experience a equal to it in overall quality . Sofitel ha a much more modern and slightly more impersonal feel than the Excelsior , but it 's newer and in better shape . We 'd go back again , eventually . But first , I 'd probably try the and/or , both on the same block . They appear to have a bit more negative aspect of our stay wa getting our car back from valet on Sunday morning . It took 30 minute a we were quoted at the time . There were lot of complaint from the crowd waiting ahead of u . Not sure if this wa a or issue . \n",

      " Review:  awful Booked this via last the morning of arrival . The cost for a five star property appeared very good value for money . As always , a big mistake ! I can only assume they keep this horrid little room for that purpose ! Most probably it make more money than any other room in the hotel . The room wa described a a junior suite which it is not . It ha a totally seperate , , tiny sitting room . The bedroom ha a view of an courtyard ' ie . and quite . Bathroom had large corner bath but wa small and very contemporary toiletry ; ie no face cloth or more basic than soap and cheap shampoo . What a shame I would never dream of recommending the property to anyone . It is not suitable for business a facility are not five star if one ha an important day nor located well for tourism . The staff have been very pleasant which made a difference . My other big complaint is that I went to make a call last evening and attempted to turn down CNN only to realise it wa the volume of the TV from the room next door that I could not ! ! \n",

      " Review:  Below Average to say the least I wa at Breezes Aug 4 -- Aug 8 , 2003 . Upon arrival at the hotel , did not have our hotel reservation . The staff claimed to have called and over a copy of our confirmation and for the entire stay claimed to never have received an answer . The accomodations were mediocre . There are no king-sized bed at the hotel . Children all over the place . We were unable to make a reservation at any of the restaurant because they were all booked for the time we were to be wa polite . Hotel guest were basically unfriendly . Food below par . Buffet is never hot enough for me . There were 2 power outage in 4 day . Breezes ha no . I would not recommend this resort for couple over . Would I go back , no . \n",

      " Review:  Find somewhere else to stay I stayed at the Roosevelt in January for business , because I wanted something historic . This wa honestly the worst hotel experience I have ever I actually got to the hotel ( which is no small with all the traffic from the Kodak ) , I realized that I had to go downstairs ( dragging suitcase ) into a dark reception area . They told me to come back in about a half an hour to check in because they had no clean room ( at their normal check in time ) .I eventually checked in and found the room to be small and the entire hotel to be dark and . My shower also leaked all over the floor , due to poor design , a opposed to a need for the second night I wa there ( a Tuesday , mind you ) , there wa some sort of event going on . Parking wa a major issue . Once I returned to the hotel , I realized the bass from whatever music wa playing wa so loud I could barely talk to the other people I wa traveling with . My room wa on the 4th floor and thing in the room literally from the from the music . I think I finally fell asleep out of sheer at around 2 tried changing hotel for the final 2 night of my stay , but could n't find anything ... . \n",

      " Review:  Not good value We have just returned from three day at the Disneyland Hotel . I had read the review on Trip Advisor and decided to stay based on their we were very disappointed in a number of way . We paid around per night for our whole family ( three young child ) , bed and breakfast - maybe it sound like good value to some , but this wa for one room . There were no tea or coffee making facility in the room , so you have to go downstairs for a very expensive cup of coffee , or order from room service again , even more is no mini bar fridge in the room , so if you want to keep a baby 's bottle chilled , or cool mineral water etc , you can not . Both of these measure seem designed to ensure that guest have to buy everything from the hotel . The hotel shop doe n't sell anything useful for a family such a mineral water or snack for the park - again ensuring that all money go to the hotel or park 's restaurant . The hotel restaurant are fine but budget for an extra 60 euro a head for dinner ( le for child ) meaning each time we ate there cost around 200 euro . Over three day you should budget for around an extra 1000 euro just for basic food and drink . So for one room plus five meal at the hotel ( restaurant in the park are n't much cheaper ) we left at how quickly the cost up . We also felt by Disneyland - every shop sell Disneyland product only . The nearest pharmacy is a train ride away - we left we found a small supermarket in the railway station next to the hotel - the staff at the hotel wo n't tell you about this a it might mean you dare to buy a few thing at normal price , such a , or bottled water or small snack for the our child enjoyed Disneyland we felt used , and thoroughly by the hotel and the park . Other people we spoke to said the same thing . Think hard before booking this hotel - the room rate might seem ok , but all the extra quickly up in this Disneyland said all this , the staff were very friendly even when it wa terribly busy and they deserve a thank you . \n",

      " Review:  than bad I travel to New Orleans often and generally prefer to stay at Inns and small hotel in the quarter . My wife and I booked a king room at the Historic French Market Inn based on the hotel 's website . The check-in experience wa slow , with only one very unprofessional hotel associate working behind the desk . There wa no one available to help with bag . We were given our key and rather direction to find our room , which wa a problem since the hotel is a of building , hallway and alcove . The room we were given , # , wa totally unacceptable . No window at all , poor lighting , dingy carpet and furnishing . The room had a very musty odor , by the sense of being closed in , since the room had no window . Given the hallway configuration and limited , I would question whether part of this hotel meet fire code . The bathroom wa in terrible shape . in the sink and tub , stained and missing grout , dead roach , etc . I went back to the front desk and told the associate that the room wa unacceptable . I wa told that the only other room wa a queen - which I accepted ( although no adjustment wa made for price ) . This room , # 110 , wa directly off the first . If it wa a queen size bed , it wa the smallest queen size bed I 've ever seen . The room wa so small that there wa hardly walking room on either side of the bed . The only furniture in the room wa a straight chair , two very small lamp table on either side of the bed , and a service - which wa totally useless since it wa in an alcove completely blocked by one of the lamp table . The television wa a flat panel mounted on the wall - which wa good , since there would have been no room to put any other type of television . The bad news wa that the remote wa missing and it took several call to the desk to locate a replacement . The bathroom wa acceptable , with only a tile shower instead of a tub . The bed wa uncomfortable , to the middle . I 'll assume it wa clean just because I do n't want to think otherwise . At 3:30 AM a group of decided to have a party at one of the table in the courtyard directly outside our door . A call to the front desk did not help the problem . Trying to be objective , I 'm sure there are nicer room in the hotel . I 'll never know for sure , however , since I 'll never stay at this property again . \n",

We particularly liked the Italian restaurant across the river a well a an excellent restaurant which ran along the side of the were both very reasonably priced although a common problem in all German restaurant is the high of smoker . The hotel wa modern , clean and efficient . We had standard room on the 4th floor which were also suitable for disabled guest - these room were very spacious with an enormous state of the art shower . Breakfast wa excellent although busy during the week due to conference . Even at it busiest everything wa well stocked and nicely presented . We found the staff to be efficient and helpful in particular the certainly stay here again . Excellent value for money . \n",

      " Review:  We enjoyed our stay but had trouble with staff We stay at the Circle for 4 night in the middle of Feb. We had booked this stay back in Dec. and made special arrangement to make sure that our Ocean Front room wa 8th floor or higher for a better view . Our flight wa 3 hour late coming in so we called the hotel to let them know when we arrived in town and to hold our room for u . we were told no problem so we went out to eat at Duke 's first and checked in around . The night clerk put u on the 3rd floor , one of the lowest one in the property . When I asked why we were not given the room I wa promised , we were told it wa because we checked in so late ... 1st come ... 1st serve . I then said , but we called and booked 8 or higher , we were then told , it doe n't matter . I wa told to come down in the morning and ask to move . I asked to be moved everyday we were there and told they had nothing higher . On the next to the last day we were there I went to open our door of our room , IT WAS N'T ! The housekeeper never closed our door all the way and all of our stuff wa right there for anyone to steal if they even tried to just push the door open . I then hit the roof , between this and them not changing our room , I kind of lost it with the desk clerk and told him just what I thought of the staff . It wa n't until then that he said now in the morning again they have a higher room ... , but we would have to hang around and wait and see in the morning , wasting more time . He offered u a room on our last night on the 11th floor even though he had one on the 14th floor and even after all of this did n't want to give u the highest floor . I could have been missing a LOT of property from the unlocked door but never claimed anything wa missing , thank God it wa not and the housekeeper did , mistake DO happen but the front desk help here could really care le to help out location , super view from top floor , bad service from front desk ... stay here WAY Jose ! ! \n",

The location is central but still removed enough from the of the city center . Rooms are clean , very comfortable and canal side room have great view . The hotel ha been decorated with care . Really one of the nicer hotel experience we have had in a long time . Staff seemed completely dedicated to service and were helpful . \n",

      " Review:  's egg that centrally located elderly hotel in San Francisco are going to have to operate within space , this hotel had one huge problem . It ha only one small elevator so that , if it is not actually already being used by room service or the maid , you may have to share a ride with well virtually anything that need to go up or come down in a hotel.The location also mean that daylight is at a premium in the hotel and the general lack of direct light wa by some very coloured decor ( presumably because of the style being ) . This is particularly on the stair . There is no natural light and the light is not overly bright , yet they have laid brown carpet which make it very difficult to see the edge of the stair . With the elevator problem making to the stair for ( even at four floor up ) a more frequent then usual , particular care had to be room , whilst generously and quiet , also lacked daylight and wa not lit . It wa a bit depressing . The shower wa good for such an old building . The lack of tea making facility wa not helpful particularly since the bar served dreadful coffee ( we did n't dare ask about tea ) were helpful , although some seemed overly commission , and there wa no one to help with case . The location is very good . \n",

      " Review:  sorry folk this place stink First off some . Me and my girlfriend visited this resort between march 15th to the 22nd 2005 We are in our early thirty and are middle class from . Im late on this review because I wa just interested in taking the time to write this after a vacation . Were going to mexico this year and wish I would have the warning from the not so great review on . Rooms : Check in went fine the people are very sincere and helpful . Our first room had a huge crack across the patio door , not a good first impression . We got our second room quick enough , I tried to open the patio door and the handle fell off . The drain in the tub wa clogged , the light didnt work , the ac wa a joke . The tv wa tiny I mean tiny . The gap in the door were so big a 6 year old could have it open with a butter knife . If you insist on going to this resort make sure you get a room in the newer building , much : People trust me when I say the food wa just horrible . Im not a picky person but it the same up crap every single day ! ! ! The so called arent much better , it wa like the buffet food served to you with a fancy plate and a waiter . The beach grill is not what one might folk . Its not like there some guy out there on a open pit hot grill serving up great burger and all beef , it a joke cold steamed hot dog , hamburger pre cooked a mile high in the open hot air . yummy . I did get a burger and then I barely made it back to my room to you know what . We did not get sick from the food . Just stay away from those beach burger ! ! ! ! The beach : The beach wa great , no complaint . swimming in the ocean wa great the weather wa just awesome . What bothered me is that you had to leave a deposit to use any swim gear like and such . what a hassle , I usually dont carry cash when I wan na go in the resort : The ground on the resort are kept up very nice , the pool are nice except for the filthy one in the front with the swim up bar . The drink are not top shelf , That wa no biggie to me , Hey they were all free . The peacock on the resort are annoying . At first you think hey thats cool look at those pretty bird , by the second night you find yourself wishing you had a . They and while your eating , they are in the buffet building at and at you , trust me on this one the bird got ta people : The Dominican people are the nicest people on earth . The wait staff the bartender were just awesome . I know this review is not to the resort but I really dont want to take away the fact that the local people are just wonderful ! ! ! ! As for our friend the european ? ? ? ? Well what would you expect from such a . We meet some great people from the : We actually had a pretty good time looking back on it . I know some of this might sound picky or something like that but I wish I would have listened to the negative review . To me when the food is horrible and the room is just a bad it hard to enjoy yourself for 7 night , remember 7 night . At the end we basically were eating bread with butter and from the little store . Were fun people and like to a few so we made the best of closing : Hey spend a little more on yourself and go to were the review are constant 5 and 4 with a 3 thrown in from time to time . This year were going to mexico all inclusive 5 star for sure , it gon na cost about $ 250 more per person but every review for this place is 5 or 4 . Well good luck and if your all set to go to have a good time and just know I tried to help . \n",

      " Review:  Perfect ! I wa skeptical of reserving this hotel considering all the I read . You can鈥檛 always believe what you read . When we originally booked our trip , I wa trying to find a hotel that wa reasonable priced on Waikiki beach . and review are not always accurate . When we arrived at the hotel , I wa relieved . It wa perfect ! The hotel is directly across from Waikiki beach and view to Diamond Head is spectacular . We spent a lot of time at Tiki Bar and Grill . The food wa fine and the entertainment wa wonderful . Our room wa a partial ocean room and it came with free complementary breakfast . You do not get breakfast if you book a standard room , it must be a partial ocean view or above . We did not know this until we checked in . We stayed at the hotel for 8 day and I didn鈥檛 have any problem . We hardly spent any time in our room . We didn鈥檛 encounter any problem with the noise , smell or the staff . The elevator were slow a few time , but who care ! One or two minute is not going to kill you ! The room and bathroom are small , but for the price we paid , we didn鈥檛 complain . I wished we could have stayed longer . The hotel is family friendly and I would stay here again ! \n",

      " Review:  Awesome ! I wa a bit apprehensive about staying at the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach after reading some review the hotel apart , but decided to give them a chance anyway . I 'm writing this to counter any negative hotel ha an awesome location ! You can walk to many place - the beach is across the street , restaurant and store are everywhere and the Honolulu Zoo is literally next door . The room were great ! Yeah , they may be decorated in a Hawaiian you might not use in your own house , but you 're in ! ! ! Enjoy the colorful comforter and the curtain in front of your closet space - there 's nothing wrong with them . Our room wa very clean and did n't appear worn or old . We had a mini fridge , tv and little balcony . We got a partial ocean view , which wa just that , we could see the beach if we got close to the sliding glass door or were on the balcony . We could even see the sun set from there ! Our room wa on the 6th floor ( which is actually 2 floor up from the lobby ) and faced the pool . I got real nervous then because I remembered one reviewer complained about the noise from the pool and about the music . ... I heard neither ! You can hear the musician the breakfast crowd if you open up your sliding door but , aside from that there wa no noise that bothered u at any time of the day or reviewer complained about the of the breakfast . First of all , the breakfast is FREE ! ! ! Secondly , everyday they have cold cereal , fruit juice , muffin and sushi - aside from that , there is variation : cheese omelette one day ( it 's not omelette shaped and no one make it in front of you , but it 's good ) , sausage and egg biscuit another , , etc . They even provide you with little lunch box in your room to take down to breakfast , load up on goody and go wherever you want with your FREE breakfast . The only negative : the pool is small . But then again , you can walk across the street to the vast ocean . And the area of beach across from the hotel is partially off so that the water right up to the wall is no more than 6 you , this is n't the hotel , but for the price , we got an awesome deal at a wonderful hotel ! There is nothing wrong with the hotel itself , the room , the staff or the free breakfast . Despite the fact the hotel appears to be in good condition , the doorman advised u they 're currently renovating it and should be done by the end of the year . From what he told u , they 'll be flat screen tv in each room and getting new the furniture and bed . I 'm sure it 'll be even better then , but I 'm also sure someone will find fault with the renovation too . Just remember , there 's just no pleasing some people . Some people expect 5 star accomodations and staff when they only paid a fraction of what it would have cost them . We were definitely more than satisfied with our 8 night stay for the price we paid . \n",

      " Review:  Bad value for your money I wa a little disappointed with this hotel considering the amount of money I spent on it . The staff were really lovely and very helpful , but the room left something to be desired . My bed wa and the pillow were big and fluffy ( which I loved ) but the room needed some serious ventilation . The room smelt musty and and the bathroom wa n't very nice at all . They were and the water leaked on to the floor whenever you showered . The bathroom wa a bath which provided a shower head above the bathtub , but the shower curtain had mould stain ( of which looked a though someone had attempted to remove them , but without success ) . The room provided your own personal safe a chair and desk a tv with cable . room service and air conditioning ( which is where I think alot of the mould smell wa coming from ) My window were very big , but I wa unable to open them for security reason - thus having to live with the mould smell . The door and wall were very thin and I could hear almost everything that went on in the next room . Thank goodness only one person wa in there for 2 day ! ! The hotel provided a pool , and gym which were very well maintained . I stayed at this hotel for . The breakfast buffet served the same food everyday , but there wa a wide selection of fresh fruit and cereal which wa great . The hotel is a little far away from Orchard Road . You could walk there and it 'd take you about 20mins but in the heat , you 'd probably have a little more difficulty . The hotel did provide free transfer to Orchard Road and Little India though which I thought wa fantastic . , it wa an ok hotel , but the room were a little disappointing for the amount of money you pay . \n",

      " Review:  Hotel Triton ! Excellent Location , Great Staff I stayed at the Hotel from September 1st to September 5th and really enjoyed it . The hotel is in a excellent location and walking distance to almost any of the attraction that a tourist may want to see ( chinatown , union square , fisherman 's wharf etc . ) It is also a short walk to the cable car stop located only two block from the family got a taxi couple of time . The hotel staff wa courteous enough to hail a taxi for u . Also , the cafe wa closed during our stay but we had easy access to some very nice breakfast place . and were right around the corner and so is Starbucks . There is also Walgreens and right near the hotel . So , it worked perfectly for booked this hotel on priceline for $ 80 a night . I got two room which only ha a single bed . Upon a few conversation with the staff , I wa upgraded to a room with two double bed and one with a king bed without any problem . The room had a view of chinatown and did not have any noise issue . Upon reading previous review of this hotel , I had requested them not to give me a room that face the alley and my request wa met without any hotel staff had already told me that the room were about 14 by 11 in size so the size of the room wa not a surprise to me . I admit that the room could be a little more updated . My only complain is that the bathroom do not have an exhaust . Overall , my stay wa very pleasant . The staff wa helpful and informative and I would definitely stay here again . \n",

The third problem wa the billing , they charged my credit card three time for my say and took several day to fix and they were very rude about it . If i were you i wouldnt pas this hotel up . \n",

      " Review:  snobby hotel with a view This hotel ha all the amenity you 'd expect , the sort of room you 'd expect , etc etc , and a spectacular view ( I stayed at the 25th floor looking directly out over Union Square and ) . The staff wa le than helpful though , a very cool reception at check-in , not superbly attentive staff in the restaurant , and porter who only offered help with a heavy suitcase after I already had reached the door . Definitely a cold and somewhat snobby impression of the staff - even although they did everything you 'd need from hotel staff . I later stayed in the much cheaper Powell Hotel and got a ten time better treatment . \n",

      " Review:  gym cost of 10 dollar wa a bit of a surprise I wa given a floor room with a beautiful view looking west towards New Jersey . Needless to say , being at Times Square ha it advantage but also it disadvantage -- one ha to one 's way through the jungle of people just to get to the hotel . The service wa fine except for when I had checked out and I asked to store one small and light for a few hour with a baggage storage person who kept ever more loudly that he would not be in later in the day when I wa due back to retrieve my bag ie . he wanted a tip . I thought this wa a bit . The only other thing that wa a bit wa use of the excellent gym me of 10 dollar . I think for over 300 a night , this should be offered to guest or at the very list use for a fee ' should be clearly posted on their Westin internet site . Bed wa comfortable a per usual of Westin hotel . \n",

      " Review:  Great Hotel Great Location We stayed on our first 3 day in Tokyo and this hotel is a well suited nice stylish hotel perfect for all your booked a premium king room . The room wa and quite big . However my one complaint about this hotel is of their premium room have a view of facing Tokyo tower . Only standard and corner room have a tower view ( or so I wa told , when i enquired ) so bear this in mind when booking . You would think premium meant not only larger room but also better view , sadly not so . However the city view from our room wa had breakfast each morning , on final when we had to catch a to . The breakfast wa ok not huge but have 2 computer and a laptop with internet connection which wa free of charge . The lobby is beautiful and nice for a drink or two late at night.The hotel is well connected to the JR and Metro line . However can be confusing arriving for the first time . I recommend arriving at metro station , it also found the family on the ground floor of great email if you would like to know more about hotel I am happy to advise from my experience . \n",

As a Hilton Gold , we were upgraded to one of the ' room - very spacious , nice layout - located in the wing overlooking the pool ( just above the water feature . ) Our stay wa on a Saturday night , the waitress told u the next morning at breakfast that only 20 guest were registered in the hotel that night ( may be why it wa so quiet there ) .

      " Review:  Great little hotel Our first trip to SF , I chose the Hotel Rex based largely upon the review on this site , and we were not disappointed . The location , a many other reviewer have mentioned , is excellent . Close enough to Union Square to be easy and convenient , yet enough on the edge of the neighborhood to be quiet and . The , is pleasant and relaxing , the room cozy and inviting . Jazz in the room were a nice touch , the decor is interesting and attractive , and the bed wa one of the most comfortable I 've experienced in any hotel . We did n't interact too much with the staff , though they were helpful and friendly whenever we engaged them . The onsite restaurant served a great breakfast , though we did n't eat dinner there based on the limited place is perfect ... I can easily overlook the tiny elevator , the noisy air conditioner , and the sound of garbage truck in the street at 7 am , but I do have one complaint ... . Note to staff : Please clean up the pile of cigarette butt on the fire escape outside the bathroom window . I 'm coming back next year to make sure you 've done this ! ! \n",

      " Review:  Will not stay there again We just came back from our short 2 night break in Amsterdam and booked this hotel via priceline for a reasonable rate . We were very excited about this new hotel a we have stayed many time in their other hotel around the . I have never experienced such a lack of interest of staff in any other property . Maybe because it is relatively new and staff is not well trained yet ... We have booked 2 room and arrived quite early in the morning and did not expect room to be ready . It took a while to find our reservation and we were given 1 room that wa ready and were told the other one will be ready at 3 p.m. because official check in time - fair enough . We came back from town at 5 p.m. and room wa still not ready so I asked for explanation and got a response that housekeeping is very busy and did not manage to clean all room - each maid ha 25 or more room to clean - I thought - what do I care ? ? I paid my room and want a serious explanation - this is an issue for the management they are short on staff ... Finally I said please give me a call to our second room a soon a our room is ready to pick up the said OK , we will . At about I came down again to ask and room wa ready but they forgot the room number to call me ? ! ? .. Next day we wanted to take a boat trip , I took brochure at the hotel and found out there is a until 4th November only - so went to concierge and asked if they have a new one or this is still valid and there is no change - concierge at is not possible , checked it twice , went to back office and brought a pack of new actual brochure saying thank you for information ... I thought OK but there were enough staff there they could notice - we have met lot of other people at the hotel dealing with same problem ... Finally we wanted to go to Heineken for a tour - we have double checked direction with concierge and went there - we were quite surprised the exhibition wa closed more than 1 month ago until end May 2008 and they did not know about it at the hotel ... Rooms were OK , nice view over city but it wa quite cold even we set up a heating for maximum . All in all I wa very dissapointed with this property and will definitely not stay here again - will choose one of the NH hotel in the centre - , City center or NH . I would not write this review if I would experienced at least an interest from staff and a short word of apology or any other signal they do care I am a guest at their hotel . \n",

      " Review:  Our experience at the Melia Caribe My girlfriend and I recently went to the Melia Caribe from Sept 9th - 14th . After reading numerous review ( and watching the Weather prior to leaving ) , I have to say we were a bit nervous about our upcoming trip . But hopefully this review will answer a few of your question if you are headed to the resort and you will find it helpful . I 'll try to cover a much a I can , so you are a informed a you can off , I booked the trip through the hotel website ( ) . Sol Melia resort actually offer a online guarantee , and booking wa easy and not a problem . The only thing you need to be aware of when booking through the hotel website is that they will NOT charge your credit card when you make your reservation ; they charge your card when you check into the hotel . Based on the review here on tripadvisor.com , we decided to get the Royal Service flew out of Atlanta to the Dominican Republic on Delta Airlines . They offer flight twice a week , so your stay will typically be at least a few 'll arrive at the Dominican Republic airport and you walk from the plane into the terminal . You 'll have to wait in line a you enter the terminal because they take your picture and then on your flight out they have it up on the wall in case you want to buy it . After you clear the photo , you 'll have to open up your wallet or purse , and pay $ 10 per person for a tourist entry card . It is completely -- -- not a visa or anything , but the DR is a poor country and charge everyone ten dollar just to get you get your bag , you 'll be by baggage handler who are VERY to grab your bag and take them to an awaiting taxi . Word of advice -- - carry your own bag . It is only a short walk to the taxi area and you do n't know what can happen to your bag if you let someone else take them from you . Taxis are lined up outside the terminal . Do n't accept a standard price from taxi driver -- bargain them down . Most will take you to your resort for $ 20 ( they typically start at $ 25 ) . The drive to the Melia Caribe is boring , so do n't bother pulling out your camera . Once we arrived , we showed the baggage handler our reservation and he took u to the Royal Service lounge / reception area . The staff in the Royal Service lounge is very nice . They present you with drink when you come in and immediately get you checked into your room . At the lounge you are introduced to your personal butler , who take care of everything from there . Our butler wa Pablo , and he wa great for the duration of our stay . Your butler will drive you to your room , unload your baggage , show you how to work the safe , and then leave you alone to enjoy your vacation . If you are looking for a great butler , ask for room wa nice , but the bed is n't the most comfortable in the world . It wa not very and actually slightly in the middle . The bathroom situation is pretty ( a it is next to the shower and pretty much in view of the entire room ) , so if you are n't comfortable with the bathroom habit of your member , you will be by the time you get done with your trip . The jacuzzi in the suite is nice , and your butler will get it filled up and ready to go by whatever time you like . We had Pablo take care of our jacuzzi tub twice during our stay and it wa great . I 'd recommend bringing a candle that will last you the week ( or some bug spray ) because the mosquito will be in your room every night if you do n't have anything . The maid clean your room every day and your fridge . The room service menu is VERY . They have a few sandwich , small pizza , and , and that is it . So do n't expect a Royal Service villa are right next to the Gabi Restaurant and the Royal Service pool . The pool is great and is surprisingly VERY CLEAN . I actually swam around the pool with and wa pretty shocked to see how clean it wa . The pool is great and ha plenty of private cabana if you need some shade from the sun . My girlfriend and I spent most of our time at the beach , which wa awesome . White sand beach , clear turquoise water ... really did n't get much better . We had fantastic weather during the week we were there ( even though the Weather rain all week ) . The beach staff wa n't too great , but they will give you towel , get your drink , and for the most part they leave you alone . Beach activity are , but everything cost money ( even the so-called free activity ) . We went snorkeling with shark , and it wa a great afternoon activity . Stick to the beach if you are looking for a relaxing time , with family or to this point I really have not had any complaint about the resort , and you 're probably wondering why I only gave the Melia Caribe three star . My biggest complaint is the food . The restaurant are really sad in term of selection , quality of food , and variation of menu . Even the Gabi Restaurant , which is supposed to be the best on on the resort , is pretty sad . The service is very good , but the food just is n't that great . Do n't expect gourmet meal anywhere you go . About the only restaurant that I even thought wa OK wa the mexican food restaurant , La Hacienda . Drinks are also pretty , with not much alcohol content . The wine is not great either . I actually felt bad because a lot of the waiter will actually ask you if they can do anything to make your dining experience better , but the quality of food is just overall , the experience that my girlfriend and I had at the Melia Caribe Tropical wa good . It wa a very relaxing vacation for the two of u and the resort is beautiful . Be prepared not to eat too well , and you 'll be just fine . I hope this review helped you to plan your visit , and enjoy your trip ! \n",

The hotel is in a good location at the side of the Montjuic park ... quite peaceful after a hectic day in the town ... easy to reach the centre by are however a few thing to look out for : , the buffet breakfast come a little expensive at 15 euro a head and there is no simple coffee and pastry option until after 10am . Secondly , they sometimes reduced rate on their web site . So you can find yourself staying in a room for with your neighbor paying only euro . , when I booked this year we asked for a superior room . On arrival we were placed in what turned out to be a standard room . Now having been there before we knew that it wa a standard room so I contacted reception . I checked on the room rate first and they confirmed that I wa paying the superior room price . Only after challenging them further did they finally admit that we had been given a standard , it look like yet another case of beware ' . \n",

The room is very basic - need better cleaning ( glass had stain and shower could have been cleaner ) . The furniture wa old and scratched . We ate twice at the hotel , once wa by the pool were I had the worst chicken sandwich of my life . It wa only the next day that I saw the bird walking all over the buffet . The breakfast buffet wa good and service excellent , however we a we sat at a outside table we noticed the ground wa littered with old sugar packet , match and such . The beach in front of the hotel wa great - the best part of the visit . The location wa close to the sight , however we had difficulty finding good local restaurant that were within walking distance . We did n't really use the pool area a it wa a small pool and not very deep ( 1 1/2 ft and about 4 ft ) . The deeper end and the hot tub were always full of kid and not very comfortable . Overall is wa a good experience , but I would expect to pay Marriott Courtyard rate versus what we paid . \n",

      " Review:  Nothing but a Good , Solid Hotel This hotel is very good but do n't expect anything fancy . Check-in wa professional but not particularly warm . Room had no view but wa very quiet . Room wa very clean but they failed to put toilet paper in our bathroom for 2 day in a row . Beds were very comfortable and the climate control system worked well . Breakfasts are nothing special but plentiful , clean and easy . Location is great especially if you want to be in the Theatre District . Good restaurant are nearby although we found Ray 's Pizza across the street to be very mediocre but passable if you are too tired to go elsewhere . Overall , this is a good place to stay . \n",

Was given great information on all the attraction on the island and a great coupon book with many buy 1 get 1 free location is right across the street from the beach and a few block away from a mall with many place to eat and shop . I would recommend this place to again to everyone at the aqua palm . \n",

      " Review:  All that is Not Gold ! ! First of all , let me say that I am an avid Tripadvisor user and for the most part , in spite of the fact that people can complain about thing that are not that important to me , usually the overall feeling about a place is when you look at what people are saying repeatedly . The mixed reviewer in my book were pretty much on target and I really should have listened and stayed somewhere else ! Things that are important to me are food , service , and ambience . The food at this resort is not very good at all . We could always find something to eat , such a fresh fruit , bread yogurt etc . but for $ 600 a day for a family of four , you do n't want to have to around for something that is . We never sat down and said , . When we sat down for lunch or dinner , we were done with our meal often before someone brought u our drink . Service here wa far from stellar . There wa never anyone down at the beach asking if you would like something to drink like at other all inclusives we have been to . This place definitely is HUGE and deep , so it kind of felt like a development , with a beach at the end . Really hard to describe the feeling unless you experienced it . Another ... . you had to pay $ a day ! ! ! to use the spa which is a sauna , steam , some shower and cold whirlpool . That can really add up for a family of 4 . The gym is very small ( 3 treadmill , 1 , 1 and some weight ) for a resort of 3000 or so people . My son ( 17 ) really like to go to the gym on vacation , because like many 17 year old , he get bored easily and the word relax is not often in his . Which brings me to another point . The place is so HUGE you rarely see the same face more than twice . They do not do a good job in bringing people together , so if you have teen , there is no program where they can meet each other . There is no teen disco or teen night . This resort is geared more for older single who like to amount of alcohol and party till the wee hour and then go around singing and waking people up at 4 in the morning . ( no joke , that happened to u 2 night in a row ) The resort is also probably more tolerable for family with small child who have to watch their kid ... and better to watch them in a pool then running around the house up north in February . Also , kid can eat hot dog , chicken finger and french fry ( one of the only consistently good thing at the ) and think they are in Disney World . Also kid like to get on and off trolley and believe me , you are doing that all the time . Forget this place if your back hurt , or have foot problem or do n't like to walk in the heat . Its nice to get some exercise when you are on vacation , if you need to walk off your wonderful meal , but if this is not the case , then this HUGE resort can get sooo . Also there are no elevator so if you are , you are stuck between a rock and a hard place , because the upper floor are the better room , le humid and probably le buggy , but you have to walk up three flight of stair to your room . This place is about quantity , not quality . If you are from Europe , and you are not in any of the category that I mentioned that would have a problem with this type of place , and your Euro go really far here , this place might make you happy . But for u , we would never come back here again . The DR in itself , a other reviewer have mentioned is a place where your resort is everything because you do n't go outside the resort . So when you enter into paradise it had better meet your expectation otherwise you feel like you are at summer camp when all you want to do is go home , no matter how nice the weather . The room were fine , our maid wa lovely and kept our room clean . The front desk wa helpful when called upon and the resort itself is kept very clean . It 's funny , because the place is clean and somewhat new , it take more than your first impression to realize that all that certainly is NOT Gold at this resort . \n",

      " Review:  SF wa even better because of the St. Francis We booked a very last minute reservation to San Francisco and selected the Westin St. Francis through Travelocity because of the combo price of airfare and hotel . We 've stayed in numerous luxury hotel in the city and this one rate right up there with the best of them . To our surprise , it wa a suite . We are not disabled , but the room wa quite spacious and the bathroom wa well equipped for someone who wa . The location of this hotel is wonderful , you ca n't beat Union Square for shopping and theater and a bustling nightlife . We especially loved being right on the cable car line . Their service personnel , including the doorman , the concierge and the front desk were professional and efficient . We highly recommend staying at the Westin St. Francis on your next trip to SF . As a side note , booking through Travelocity made this trip a breeze . We 've booked in every possible way imaginable online , and I think Travelocity is one of the best . Their guarantee of a specific room type , non-smoking , all tax and fee prepaid , made this trip even better . In our experience , this ha not been true in the past of other online travel company . \n",

      " Review:  The worst place I have ever stayed ... management should all be This place is without a doubt the worst place I have ever stayed in the world . To start with , I get there to check in and the woman behind the counter blow me off for 20 while she call and talk to various people on the phone . after all that she look up to tell me that she then ha to wait for someone else to come down before she can think about checking me in . Extremely frustrated I get them to hold my bag so that I can go and show my wife the city for her first time . When I get back , I have to go through the entire check in procedure all over again and then the guy behind the counter say he ha to get a photo ID from everyone staying in the room ? ? He say that it is case of fire they have a picture to look for me . To this they mine and my wife 's driver 's and blanket out NOTHING . THIS IS A ! ! ! ! ! RIGHT TO MY ! ! ! I then went the next morning to retrieve this photo since I wa leaving they no longer need it . However , then I wa told by the girl behind the counter that it is HOTEL to take ALL of these photo and forward them to the corporate office ! ! ! it is not only a security risk , but with a driver number and address , can get a credit card IN MY . Neither talking with the girl behind the desk or the manager would get my info back . This policy is not posted anywhere or written down anywhere on any information , so if you do n't want your information floating around their unknown , DO N'T STAY THERE ! ! ! Other reason not to stay there : This room is the smallest room I have ever been in ... in the entire world . There wa literally 2 foot of space on three side of the bed . The bed itself wa a double size to boot so that tell you how small the room wa . Of all of the service in the basement that they offered , the only thing that were working wa the vending machine with the disposable razor and the ice elevator doe not have a safety and nearly cut me in half . Fortunately , I work out so I wa able to force the door back open . ( This wa at the lobby level and no one seemed to care about the fact that I wa caught in the that I had a view , but the window did n't open conclusion , this is the worst place I have ever stayed and I am now everyone to stay away from this place . \n",

      " Review:  Nice Hotel - Great Location - will stay again I wa pleasantly surprised after reading the bad review . I just returned after staying there Sept . When you walk into the hotel - there is a concierge desk with people to greet you on your right - but the front desk is easily to see from the front door on your left . They have renovated their bar area and added a courtyard outside with large lounging chair and with a glass around the area to keep the wind out . The inside bar ha nice tall bistro table for evening cocktail . The new renovated room are very nice with a large plasma tv and very comfortable large king bed . The hotel is older but the renovation they have made are a . The shower have good water pressure and the maid service wa great . I believe a few who wrote bad review regarding maid service never read the card that are left on in your room at check-in . They state to please leave this card on the bed each day if you want your linen changed on the bed . Also , if you throw your towel on the floor they will be replaced with fresh one . If they are hanging on the wall or door - those towel will not be replaced . The hotel is in walking distance to many site - pier 39 . Breakfast place within a block IHOP and . Lots of shopping for gift and in walking distance to both cable car Powell Market and Hyde St Powell . the 3-day Muni pas which gave u unlimited ride for the cable car , streetcar , bus system . Great restaurant and sightseeing such a Alcatraz . This is a must and you can walk to Pier 33 if you so desire . did a fantastic job on the Wine Country Tour . Book your Alcatraz ticket early if you actually want to go on the island and walk through the cell . There are many company that will take you by - meaning they sail around it and do not stop . You really need to take the Alcatraz that take you by ferry over . It 's about a hour tour . Well worth it too . Back to the Sheraton - we had a room by the street . No problem with noise a mentioned . Air condition work great . I checked out the hotel in Union Square and the business district . I wa not that impressed in their location . I did not like the high rise , with lot of traffic and noise and the only shopping I saw wa what I could go to any mall and pay le than the price they had in their store . So I feel I made a wise choice staying where I did and when I return I will stay with the Sheraton Fisherman 's Wharf . \n",

      " Review:  Great value ! If you are looking for a luxurious hotel , do not stay here . If you are looking for a place to stay in NYC that give you more than just a bed - stay at the Best Western Hospitality House . We were a total of 4 - 2 adult , 2 kid . You ca n't beat staying in an apartment ( yes , an apartment ) with enough room for everyone . The kid slept on the sofa bed , we had the bedroom . Both had TVs and were comfortable . The kitchen ha all you need to make your own meal ( if that is something you want to do to save $ $ ) . Breakfast is provided for you in the way of bagel , cream cheese , fruit , milk juice , coffee , hot chocolate , etc . We saved money and time by eating breakfast before we left to see the sight for the day . All of the staff I spoke to were very nice and helpful with direction , recommendation , etc . Housekeeping wa thorough and even kind enough to leave extra when we asked for more . You are within walking distance to all public transportation and many of the sight like Plaza , Time Square . The only thing I have to complain about is the odor in the hall right off the elevator . It wa confined to that space though - the room wa fine . We were all very happy staying at the Hospitality House and would not hesitate to recommend to all . Also , they do allow pet ( the guest across from u had dog and cat in her room ) . If you want luxury , go somewhere else . If you want a spacious room in the heart of NYC , get more for your dollar by staying at this hotel . \n",

      " Review:  amazing vacation ! We were a group of 17 people with the age ranging from 45 to 5 year old . we got to the resort at about 7 pm and were checked in right away with out a problem . We had asked to all have a room together and it wasnt a problem ... . the front desk were very helpfull and spoke very well in english . The beach wa absolutely incredible and by far the best beach on all of the strip ! yes there is some sea weed but so doe every other beach ... . and they do clean it up early in the morning wich we witnessed .. they work very hard to keep it clean but it all through out the day . We did not have any problem with beach chair but we also did have an early riser who saved some in the morning ... just dont be about it and save chair on the beach and by the so our first experience with the a la carte wasnt bad at all we were seated right away and it wa delicious and awesome service ... but our second at the shore grill we werent so lucky we waited a long time to be seated and once we were in the service wa horrible ... we got stuff we never then that little incident at the restaurant the service wa absolutely incredible everyone wa friendly with you if you treated them with respect ... . the staff were great and were awesome ! but they could have had a little more going on but it understanding because it is a new resort , and all the bartender were but every time you order a drink it will taste different we had 2 18 year old and 4 16 year old our trip and we were all very dissapointed when we found out that there wa no disco but we with it and at the sport bar with the two best bartender and Mercedes .. the two nicest people we met on our trip ! The last few night we made our own little disco in the sport bar we brought our ipod and the station and just started dancing ! it wa great As for the pink and green bracelet ... we personally did not see any difference ... . we even got served alcohol .. you just got ta be nice ! and just a little tip if your planning on doing any tour ... stay away from swimming the shark and stingray ... the water is sooo rough that if your not a strong swimmer be in and out of that water . most of the kid in our group just found it too rough ... but the teen enjoyed the experience but had nothing else to compare it to ! The ground are beautiful and very modern ... . the resort is kept very air conditioned ... some night we even wore cuz we were kinda chilly ... . a for the mosquito i think i saw maybe one or two of them really not a big we had an incredible time ... . but we were a very group and didnt make a big deal over certain thing ... the resort isnt perfect ... but one day will be once they iron out the little problem We were thinking of moving resort when we were reading all of these review but we extremly happy we werent able to , it wa a gorgeous resort with the best beach great food and awesome people what more could you ask for ... your trip is what you make it ! \n",

      " Review:  Not a Gem This hotel wa a dump . The staff wa friendly and helpful , but the hotel is old and worn out . The room are tiny and the hallway were so hot ! We had to move room because the air conditioning ( yes , that 's how old it is ) had no blind , so your option were waking up at the crack of dawn to the sun or sweating to death . We chose sweating the first night and then asked if to move to a room with a blind , which were able to do , otherwise , I would have demanded my money back . The coffee shop doe n't open until 7am , there is no actual restaurant on premise , even though it state there is , it is attached to a Brazilian Steakhouse , but you have to walk around the block to get to it ? ? I took my mother to NYC for the first time in her life and wanted to be near the touristy attraction , Rock , Times . I paid over $ 600 for 2 night ( all other hotel were the same price ) and it wa a total waste of money . The picture on Expedia were completely deceiving , I will never stay at a hotel again . \n",

We also the hotel to confirm our request . A few day before departure the hotel sent u an email asking if we had any special request , we confirmed our original request . On arrival we were given a low floor room with a view of a wall ! The wardrobe door were broken and would n't we reminded them of our request we were given the only room they said wa available which wa a disabled room on the 14th floor . Although we had a partial view of the Empire State the room wa still very noisy from around 5am when the traffic would start ( I might add that I can sleep through almost anything ) . The only mirror in the room wa above the in the bathroom therefore it wa impossible to check how we looked before going out . If anyone using the room wa confined to a wheelchair they would not be able to use the mirror at all . The air con / heating system wa incredibly noisy , not something you could during the night . I to think what it would be like to stay here during a New York this , the staff on duty were lovely and friendly . The breakfast were OK , nothing special really , but hey , they are free . We did try the free evening snack on the Monday , a , and found it pretty disgusting . I think for the money I would choose another hotel such a the Sofitel . \n",

We chose it because of the positive Trip Advisor review , it , and the good rate we found . The hotel did n't disappoint - it looked new and modern throughout , and the room are great . it 's a Residence Inn , the standard room come with more than the average hotel room : a kitchenette and table , a small sitting area ( couch , chair , and coffee table ) , plus the usual king-sized bed , and a large bathroom . The flat-screen television so it could be watched from the couch or from the bed , which I thought wa pretty cool . Everything wa spotless and very desk - staff wa very friendly and helpful , and we checked in and out with no trouble at all . They also gave u map and reliable direction for getting to the main used the gym one morning - small room with two treadmill , two bike , an , and some free weight . The usual hotel gym setup , with a tv hanging from the ceiling . wa clean and all in working did n't use the ( indoor ) pool , but the gym look right out on it . Pretty small , but it looked like there wa hot tub - part of the room rate , so we had it the morning we left . Nice layout of breakfast standard : scrambled egg , bacon , pastry , a well a cereal , yogurt , and some fruit . Most , the server at breakfast were very friendly and helpful , even though they were very busy with a room full of hungry , good for tourist . Nothing really within a block of the hotel , but only a few minute walk to the CN tower , the waterfront area , some nightlife , and we even walked to the district - about 25 minute , but pleasant even on a cold day because the sun wa I recall , the hotel charge $ for parking , and the garage nearby are similarly priced ( and ) , so this can add a significant amount to your bill , just be , we really enjoyed our stay . A modern , spotless , and comfortable hotel , with friendly service , in a good location , at a reasonable price . \n",

The lobby and the casino were very lively , it wa the place to be for a weekend night . Had the room been a little bigger and luxurious , I would have given this hotel higher mark .

      " Review:  This is a wonderful hotel with friendly staff I recently visited Beijing from Jan with my who happens to be Chinese . I decided to book 3 hotel just to keep the week interesting a we were only going to stay in Beijing . We spent a bit more time IN the hotel than sightseeing a it wa VERY cold in Beijing the week we were there . Anyway for me especially , I loved the Park Plaza hotel . When we first checked in a friendly staff member tried to get u to upgrade to a suite from the deluxe room we already booked . Though the suite sounded good ... included the Breakfast buffet plus a free 2 hour happy hour I still declined the in wa very quick and very friendly . We got to the Deluxe room and immediately I noticed it wa VERY clean , smelled wa rather modern . However after a few hour I felt the Deluxe room wa just a bit small . ( The other 2 hotel we stayed at also offered rather small maybe this is just the way it is in Beijing , say v a hotel in NY ) We contacted the front desk later that day and asked to be upgraded to the suite the next day . When we finally moved to the suite ... it wa in a quiet corner of the hotel I felt feel like home . So the next 2 day we stayed in the it wa just wonderful . Modern electronic thermostat in 2 room , 2 bathroom , 2 tv etc . All this for about $ 40 more a you get free breakfast and the happy hour . If you like to drink ( I do n't ) you can get a much Johnny Black or a you can handle plus some finger type food . I only mention this because I happen to be a and Johnny Black is NOT cheap . So if you like to drink a little , the upgrade more or le pay for itself . The Breakfast buffet we felt wa pretty good ... and I felt everything wa rather tasty and fresh I wa most impressed with the cleanliness and overall of being VERY at home rather than in some cold strange hotel . There wa just a good vibe about the Park Plaza I did not at all feel about the other 2 hotel we stayed at very nearby . I think for the Park Plaza is a VERY nice friendly place to stay . When I got home to NY I wa asked to fill out a survey that the Plaza asked if I would do for I gave it good shortly received a personal letter of thanks from the hotel seem to genuinely want to please . Overall I think most people would have a nice stay here ... if you can afford it , the Suite to me wa a big plus ! ! \n",

      " Review:  The Perfect Choice in Florence The Hotel Alessandra wa the perfect hotel for our stay in Florence . My and I visited the hotel just last week and loved it ! The location can not be beat . It sits on a quaint and quiet street , yet it is just a block from the Ponte Vecchio and a few block from the . We were able to walk everywhere , even the train station for our day trip out of the city ( without luggage ) . Andrea wa extremely kind and helpful , a were the other staff , and the room ( we stayed in two since we extended out stay at the last minute ) were spotlessly clean and very spacious . Although there is a walk up 2 flight of stair to reach the elevator , this wa not a problem for u at all . In fact , much of our trip in Italy had u walking the city for hour , so what is an extra flight of stair ? When we return to Florence , and I know we will , we will definitely stay here you Andrea \n",

      " Review:  Good location We arrived at the Travelodge early after a long flight from for a overnight stop before heading out . Since we arrived early , we were able to check in early . Once we arrived up to our room , they gave u twin bed instead of a queen bed like we had booked . Since there were load of people downstairs and they did let u check-in early , we confirmed that our reservation wa in for a queen , but they did not have one available that time so we let it go . The hotel wa fairly clean , but the shower had no bottom . It wa only a tile floor with a drain . It is in pretty good location a it is within walking distance to Circular Quay , but it is a pretty good walk . There were a ton of younger people here , probably because a reasonable price , so I would rate it a one step above staying at a backpacker hotel . Would probably consider other option before staying here again . \n",

      " Review:  Ocean Blue - Only `` Okay `` My husband and I stayed at Ocean Blue from April . My first impression of the country - a soon a I had got off the plane and onto the bus - wa Oh my God , where did we go ? It wa a little scary seeing men with machine gun along side the road . However , we were told this wa common in the DR , although that did n't keep me from took a 6 a.m. flight , which put u in PC around 10 . Of course , when we arrived , our room were not ready , a check-in is not until 3 p.m. That wa no worry , a there is a bar right in the main lobby and I wa thirsty ! We sat at the bar for a few drink and decided to walk down to the ocean , which , of course , wa every bit a beautiful a I had it would we finally got to check in , we were first put into Villa 3 ( we later switched to Villa 5 , where we should have been to begin with , a that is the Apple Vacations Villa ) . The room itself wa nice . It wa cool from the air conditioning and the bathroom wa nice and big . For a hotel that is only a few year old , some age wa starting to show in the bathroom , but other than that , the room wa fine . We did have a stocked fridge with beer , water and pop . All we had to do wa ask the maid and she graciously it everyday that she cleaned . note about - because it is such a large resort , sometimes your room do not get cleaned until the afternoon . Please be aware that these woman work VERY hard , sometime the entire day ... we left our maid a few dollar on the dresser each day.The first day we ate only at the main buffet , where we ended up normally eating the rest of the time . I do not eat red meat , but I did n't want to take a chance and eat any of their meat , because they process it differently than we do , but I did take advantage of the huge bread bar , which wa delicious . The lunch and dinner varied - they were hit or miss . Sometimes they were good , other time ... well ... let 's just say I ended up eating pizza on more than one occasion ! My husband only got sick once and that is because he ate their steak . Although I had warned him about the meat , he did n't listen ! However , he is not a picky eater at all and ate nearly everything else on the buffet - including chicken , calamari , ... you name it - and wa fine . Service wa much better on one side of the buffet too . Once they saw that you were willing to tip for service , they your drink , over and over - many time they were stronger than the previous ! The dessert are incredible looking , although they are also hit or miss . One wa a coffee cake , which wa really tasty , although by the end of the week , started tasting stale . We assumed they had just kept putting the remainder of the cake out each day so by the end of the week it wa ! There wa one dessert which looked and when my husband took a bite , he could only describe it a Coffee . At least we got a good laugh out of it ! We did end up eating once at - and neither of u cared for their food at all ... so we stuck with the main buffet the rest of the is a little tricky - all I ate were the pancake - which were just okay - by the time we left I never wanted to see another pancake again ! The egg they put out on the buffett are floating in something - but we could n't figure out what ! The pool , of course , were awesome . You HAVE to have a . He is the bartender in the pool closest to the ocean and his service - a well a his drink - is awesome . He wa entertaining and very , very nice at all time . I noticed that he worked every single day we were there , which wa 8 day in a row , so he work very hard . Tip him well ! ! ! ! There are annoying time share people and they wait outside your villa and the buffett . They always greet you with , Hey my friend , let me ask you a question . All you have to do is say no thank you and they leave you alone . No need to be vendor on the beach are a different story ! Each day wa different . Sometimes they were in a good mood and would give you a great deal , other day , they were downright nasty . What they do not understand ( or maybe they do , they just think we 're all stupid Americans ) is that the thing they sell on the beach , we can buy here at a dollar store . What make the situation worse , is my husband and I noticed more than once that Americans were being and paying their full asking price for trinket ! Do n't do this ! Then they try to get all of u to pay full price ! The best advice I can give you when shopping at the beach vendor , is pay them about 1/4 to 1/3 of what they are asking and no more . So if they want $ 35 for a trinket necklace , offer them $ 3 to start with , but do not go any higher than $ 5 . They are not worth it.We did bring back rum - which is delicious - you are allowed to bring back 4 of alcohol , which we took advantage of ! My hubby also bought some cigar , which he got a great deal on . Many of them he purchased are sold back here for $ 200 and he got a box for just $ vendor who come directly to the resort ( they do this only one night ) are MUCH friendlier than the one on the also took advantage of a trip to the Marinarium ( sp ? ) during which my hubby swam with shark and sting ray . He got some awesome underwater photo . And they take you on a big party boat to an oasis on the other side of the island which is all , I would not return to Ocean Blue or DR , only because I would chose to go a little le next time . Although the country side wa beautiful on the boat tour , I see enough poverty everyday in the state , I did n't want to see it on my vacation . That may sound a little snooty but it 's true . You pay several thousand dollar to go on a vacation , it 's to relax , not to see poverty and men on the street with were a little by the fact that Ocean Blue is entitled All Inclusive , which to me , it is n't . An All Inclusive resort should have room service at all hour , which they did , but only for certain thing like towel . When we asked room service for food about 10 p.m. one night , we were told they only did that for Elite member . Our travel agent through Apple did not inform u think 8 day wa just a bit too much for the maybe 5 at max . If you are looking for a resort that doe not have so many child there , look somewhere else too . My hubby and I do not have child and although they did n't bother u during our vacation , it probably would have suited u better to stay at an resort ! I wa happy to be home and needle to say , came back to appreciate the thing I have a little more ! Feel free to email me any question or I can send anyone photo if they would like too ! @ \n",

      " Review:  located , helpful I just returned from a great stay at the Hotel in Amsterdam . We had room 26 ( a double room ) which worked out great since my wife and I were traveling with out 4 old son . ( Families , Room 26 wa perfect for u since it had a small room off to the side with a small twin bed just perfect for our son . ) Rose at the front desk wa particularly helpful after we left a bag at the airport . They even helped u our stay by one night by helping to contact our airline 's local number and speaking with a local agent . Our room seemed a bit larger than other typical European hotel room . Furniture wa better than average . Due to persistent rain , umbrella were always available in the lobby , which we made use of repeatedly . ( And the umbrella were not poor quality either ) .The location , in my opinion , could not have been any better for what we wanted out of a hotel room in Amsterdam . It seemed to be perfectly located amongst dozen of small shop , and coffee shop . There were so many thing to see and do which were all just a few minute walking distance from our wa a bit expensive inside the hotel , but we on our last day and I believe it wa well worth the price paid . Breakfast had great variety , egg were prepared a we requested and the coffee wa , a expected , great . Fresh fruit , juice and bread , salmon , cheese , , our stay at Hotel wa an excellent experience and since Amsterdam is so easy to reach from the US and the East ( where I work ) , we likely will return to again . \n",

      " Review:  Better than expected I wa a little bit wary about this hotel from reading other review about bug and such , but I am glad I went with the flow and stayed at this hotel . Some people complained about the distance from the red light area , but if you get tram ticket ( right outside Centraal Station at the center ) for three or four day ( unlimited ) then hop on the 4 , 24 , or 25 you are straight into town in le than five minute . And the tram run pretty much all the time . The only frustrating thing about this hotel were the tiny endless stair , but we are relatively young and were able to walk up no problem . Tiny but clean room with private bath . Would definitely stay again ! ! \n",

The hotel wa clean the staff friendly and helpful.The restaurant next door had closed but there are at least four pizza place that deliver . The hotel desk clerk suggested that the best in the area wa the Pizza Hut and . She wa right . They let u use the breakfast area for our group pizza free shuttle to the port for our cruise wa comfortable and on time . What more could you ask for a one night pre cruise hotel at such a good price . Well I could ask for a real restaurant near by , but not much else : - ) \n",

      " Review:  A Bit We stayed at Le Richelieu the first of March . We had stayed there before and found it unique and charming . I 'm afraid that since then there ha been absolutely nothing done to the place so that now it seems seedy and depressing . It come with no amenity -- not even coffee . I do n't know when I have stayed in a room that did n't have a . I asked for one -- they sent me up a pot right away but I wa told it did n't come with coffee . I went to the lobby for a cup and they charged me $ 2 . All the employee seemed old and tired and somewhat rude . Our air conditioner did not work so we had to sleep with the door to the balcony open . It wa rather loud at night . The price of the room is somewhat of a bargain but next time I will pay a little more for a lot nicer room . \n",

      " Review:  Loved the Grand Marina Stayed in Premier room , lovely room , plenty of space and storage , small balcony , only let down wa that there were no tea/coffee making facility in the room . Staff were really helpful with the exception of the nightly room assistant not being able to speak a word of English and my Spanish being very poor . Roof top pool not of much use but gym facility ok. Hotel very clean and access to bus , taxi etc very good . Tour bus stop right outside . Room service wa excellent although meal ordered wa a let down for the price , packet and sauce , not very hot either . Overall would stay again for easy access to the city , but not a hotel you would stay in for atmosphere , certainly aimed at the business world although we were n't treated any differently because we were n't business . \n",

      " Review:  New Years at Hotel Jazz Based on all the good review here , we decided to stay at Hotel Jazz for 5 night to ring in the new year . We were not disappointed . The entire staff were nice and helpful in planning our new year eve dinner and in giving u direction to get around . Our room wa always clean , the bed wa so comfy that we had to force ourselves to get up , the one trouble I encountered on the first night wa the shower - you have to make sure it is positioned right and facing before turning it on - it a and for some reason ours wa facing straight at my face when I turned it on - just a little tip . As for the metro - we were on the sixth floor and it wa only a very slight because I notice everything , but my partner never did . The very best part wa the location ! Everything wa within walking distance - La Rambla ; the shop along Passeig de Gracia where you can also see Gaudi 's Casa and La - there 's an M store a well ( it a popular chain of clothing store in Europe , in case some of you have never heard of it and may be getting it confused for something else ) ; the mall Corte Ingles which ha a grocery store in the basement for your bottled water need and much more ; Starbucks ( though you can get a yummy cup of coffee anywhere in Barcelona ) ; lot of and shoe shop ; and for anyone that 's interested in booking a guided bus tour - the Bus Terminal is directly across the street . This wa an awesome surprise since I booked the tour online thinking we 'd probably have to walk a bit or take a bus to get there , but - it wa just a walk out of the hotel lobby ! We took two guided tour of Barcelona on different day - Morning and Afternoon and they were both good . They have other tour to choose from a well , which you can book online or when you get there . Lots of place to eat - we loved which is across the street and serf a good and inexpensive breakfast . Everything wa just so convenient during our stay . The free internet wa a huge plus too - they have two computer for guest to use at any time . It wa a very memorable and relaxing vacation and we look forward to spending it there again . \n",

      " Review:  Barcelo ` Dominican Republic Beach After reading the varied review , and having already booked our dream vacation it wa with mixed that I anticipated our vacation at Barcelo ` Dominican Republic . This is a totally honest review by someone who it a hotel with out room service . Coming from the USA , and going into a country who 's national language is Spanish ; my family and myself brushed up on minimal phrase and . After reading most of the review , I also myself for staff that wa rude and . What I experienced wa anything but that . Friends had advised me that since our check in time wa at 3:00 , to pack our swim suit to enjoy the day before we could check in ; and we did just that . Upon arriving at the airport , we found our apple wa very easy to find . He directed u to our airconditioned bus ; and our from the airport to our resort wa very easy and stress free . Upon arriving to the resort , we found that the staff wa very nice ; and checked u and invited u to enjoy the facilites while our room were being prepared . We found that if you attempted some spanish that most of the staff wa more than willing to meet you more than 2 way . We encountered a small the first night being given an older room in the 4th building - the room wa older - no lock on the safe , the blow did n't work - and the mattress were lumpy and old - but it wa rectified the next day - so not a real issue . We were then given a lovely room in the 7th building on the third floor . Very very nice . On the whole - I have to give HUGE kudos to the ground keeper who kept the ground , beach and walk way pristine at all time - even during tropical storm . While down there - we experienced a severe tropical storm . It wa one day of rain - in which , the staff had day to keep the guest . Big kudos to them for that . The beach wa nice and well kept . Not sure why other guest did not enjoy - but we sure did . The only annoying issue wa the vendor who were allowed to roam the beach in order to make a buck . To be fair , the security guard were very ; and if it appeared that someone wa not wanting to be , they the vendor away . Small bad point - the beach bar wa never stocked well - it ran out of ice , water and soda before 11:00 am every day . Also - the bartender who worked this bar catered mainly to the spanish speaking guest only . Everyone else had to wait - a very long time - to be served . Best bar in the complex ? down - the main pool bar - the main bartender and are the best . They run the top side and the pool side to perfection . They were always stocked with and were to everyone - even the really drunk year old ... .. As far a the food . My family and I are not really picky ; and found something to eat no matter what . I would say , If I had to complain about anything , it is that limited ability to get a 7:00 or 8:00 pm reservation at any of the resturants . The best dinner we experienced wa the Brazilian . The most wa the Mexican . The buffett wa not bad at all . Very nice breakfast and lunch for all 8 day . As far a our experience with the staff - they went out of their way to make our stay a enjoyable a possible . I will admit that we tipped a buck or two here or there for the bartender and our maid - but we always had our room fridge stocked to the and our drink were and our service wa quick . Speaking of our room fridge - small tiny but a an FYI - you CAN NOT get diet coke in your room . If your are a diet coke a I am - get over it or pay for it at the gift shop - which is my only real beef with the entire complex . The entire 8 day we were there - the machine at the gift shop wa out of order - leading me to believe that they just wanted american - AND be prepared - if you want to buy a 20 diet coke - it 's going to be $ american money . It is what it is . All in all , we had a fantastic vacation . The staff is nice , the people you meet are nice , the food is okay ; and the ground are pristine . It is after all only a 4 apple resort - so you get what you pay for . I would highly recommend the apple trip to Saona Island - it wa the highlight to our vacation - and really worth the $ $ ! For picture , please feel free to go to and see my Punta Cana at : @ ? % . Also - huge kudos to our apple representative who wa very interested in making sure that our vacation wa we wanted it to be . If you are on an apple vacation - and do n't tell your rep any issue you are experiencing - shame on you - they are very willing to make a wonderful a I go back again - you - I absolutely hated to leave . Would I recommend this resort - again - you . All I can say to those of you who had a bad time - you did not make the most of your vacation - and you only looked for the bad - which is what you would do no matter where you went . If you go with an open mind - and the idea you are going to have a good time - you will . If you are looking for thing to - I am sure you will find them . One piece of advice for the latter group of people - stay home - and quit writing those bad you ruin several good night sleep for those of u who can find the good and fun in whatever we do . \n",

      " Review:  Has old building character , and that 's about it Paid $ mid-week for a queen bed . Nice view of Geary Street , but also come at the expense of street noise . The window were only on one window frame section , allowing a lot of street noise to pas picked this recommendation from a source : 's . Needless to say , it let me down . The building ha charm , but that 's where it end . Here 's what I did notice : ongoing construction , construction crew using the one elevator that exists in the hotel , lack of standard amenity ( room had only one working electrical outlet ) , door man that doe n't exists at most time of the day , bathroom which look like it wa on a budget ( wa abound throughout the tile ) .The wine reception between - is a nice touch , this is about the only shining area of the hotel 's hospitality . My two cent : Old charm , but that 's it . One elevator , of modern creature comfort in the bedroom ( i.e . : convenient electrical outlet , counter space in the bathroom ) must be dealt with . Management could definitely benefit if their staff would get out from behind the front desk and have more presence with their guest in the lobby and at the front door . \n",

      " Review:  Could not have asked for more My husband and I stayed here in February 2005 for a weekend city break after reading other review . The location is ideal - only a minute walk from the main bus and underground station at Placa de Catalunya and centrally located on La Ramblas . The staff were very friendly and inviting on arrival and could not have done more to help . They even remembered our room number when we returned from our day out on the second day to hand u our room key . Our room wa very comfortable and clean , not especially spacious , but they seem to have thought of everything a far a amenity are concerned ( bed , jacuzzi bath , bidet , mini-bar etc . ) . We did not have a view from our room window , but we spent most of our time exploring Barcelona anyway . Breakfast wa very nice with a good self-service selection and the staff would bring orange juice to your table and your choice of tea ( they had a huge selection of tea ) or coffee . Overall it wa an excellent base to explore this beautiful city and we could not have asked for more for the price we paid . Would definitely recommend it . \n",

Sure , sometimes the bathtub is a little and the shelf in the bathroom fall down and the light from car going up to the Japanese restaurant on the hill in back of the hotel shine in , but this place ha character ! As one who Hollywood history and a place to just crash after a crazy day in L.A. , this place is perfect . The staff is incredibly nice and helpful and the little amenity - the cold drink when you check in , the at night , the music playing when you go into the room - are great .

Franklin Avenue itself is historic - part of Without A wa here , died next door , , the Japanese Restaurant on the hill ha an incredible history , and and 's ( and 's ) house where they lived during their popular TV show is just a few block away on Franklin .

      " Review:  Valley Wing package very disappointing . agent recommended the Shangri La for the two night we would be in following our cruise . We paid for the Valley Wing which wa the more exclusive accommodation and were told the price covered breakfast , afternoon tea , canape and drink in the evening . We had stayed at the Shangri La Hotel in Hong Kong and been very impressed with the wonderful hot nibble that were offered on the buffet . We are not big drinker but we did enjoy having the evening canape that were freely on offer . However we soon discovered that the in Singapore wa quite a different . The breakfast wa fine , no complaint there and we were never in the hotel during the afternoon tea hour . However when we arrived home from shopping and touring and went down to enjoy the canape , we were suprised to be given merely one plate each with three very small and mostly cold offering . No buffet a we had been expecting and a very offering . Certainly it wa nice to have the two glass of wine we enjoyed but a far a the canape went , that wa it for the evening . After that we were told there were cooky available . Not very enjoyable with a glass of wine ... Apart from that , our room wa certainly large with a nice aspect but the bed wa very very firm . Both my husband and I ended up having to take medication for our sore back . We ordered room service one evening but the food wa very ordinary and not worth the money . We ate a hundred time better at one of the food mall on Orchard Road . So , despite paying the extra for a Valley Wing room it wa very disappointing and not worth the money . n't stay at the in Singapore again . \n",

      " Review:  I want to go back We just came back from Secrets and this wa by far one of the best vacation we have at the resort were so friendly I know people in other review have mentioned the language problem but most of the staff speak some english and do n't forget you are in a spanish speaking country and have fun learning some spanish they even have spanish lesson by the is a lot to do you can plan to be busy all day or just do nothing , lay by the pool and drink Coco Loco 's , the drink were top shelf they even have went on the tour which wa alot of fun we went snorkling half heard the outback safari wa fun but never got around to going other people at the resort said it wa is not alot of shopping at the resort so if you like to shop this is not for you the stuff they have is even expensive by US and booze are available at the duty free in the airport cheap . The ride to the resort wa long a the road are not the best but when you see how private your beach is it worth the could go on but just to finish up my wife and I had a wonderful time and we will be back Robert , \n",

      " Review:  Sofitel provides trendy elegance Our stay at the Sofitel Am in Berlin had a nature . Our first three day we were in a standard room , but for the last two day of our stay , we were upgraded to a suite . What a difference a suite make ! Our first room wa elegantly designed , but wa a bit small and lacked sufficient storage space . However , we enjoyed it style and the location of this Sofitel is simply superb a the other reviewer mentioned . The Bar , one block away , is fantastic ! The major problem of our room , which wa on the top floor , wa the heat . It wa ! Although it wa late winter in Berlin , and the wind wa and the rain pouring , we felt a if we were in . I guess heat mentioned our problem to the management , and , next thing you know we are in a suite . always come through . The suite wa simply magnificent , with two bathroom , great storage , and a hip ambiance . I must the service at this hotel . I would not hesitate staying at this Sofitel again a long a I am not posted to the highest floor . \n",

      " Review:  Great Value in San Francisco We selected this property based on review here and on the Expedia website . a comfortable room with free car parking and that is exactly what we Street id the extension of 101 south of the Golden gate Bridge so is very busy but we were give a room away from the street and it wa very quiet . The room wa spacious and comfortable . It doe not offer the such a an fridge or pay movie but lacked for nothing else . Parking wa covered and seemed here it is possible to walk to all the key area of the city , both waterfront and the Square shopping district . We also got cab without much problem when we needed Francisco ha so much to offer the visitor and only 3 day we were slightly time limited . However we did tour Alcatraz , visit and the wood , a well a ride on a cable car ( on the running board , which wa exciting ) from Powell to Market . We ate in Chinatown once , at an excellent cafe on Grant . Other than that we ate once at a Mexican restaurant on Lombard Street near the motel and and once at a fine little restaurant right by the would definitely stay at the again , although that part of Lombard Street ha many motel from which to choose . Driving back to the airport from there wa easy too . \n",

Lobby and room are more forest lodge decor while restaurant are very modern and interesting . Views from are great a you are right over the water . For those from de it could be a problem , but then it 's for your are small with fireplace and some have city view fine but not very scenic . Bathrooms are tiny but fully equipped and amenity in bathroom . Very clean , neat room . Service wa friendly if not always accurate with 's a long uphill walk to restaurant and shopping .

      " Review:  Good Service , but disappointed with room I stayed in the Swissotel , following review on this site . While the staff were efficient in the , process , I did encounter a few thing that made my stay le enjoyable . The first problem wa the room size . The room were small . Some website give the 5 star , but this is not accurate . The room were designed so there is just barely enough space on either side of the bed for me to move around in . When you look at the photo posted on the hotel 's website , the room displayed are quite ; the actual room look about the size . The study desk is small , and with all the hotel reading second problem wa the bed . The mattress wa firm , and I had a difficult time sleeping on it . It wa nothing compared to the other bed used in hotel like Sheraton . ( i.e . the Heavenly Beds ) . It took me over 2 hour to fall asleep on these bed . A third problem wa the room service . If you need any item from room service ( for example a toothbrush ) , it take about an hour for room service to have it delivered , which I think is unusually long . So in summary , the stay wa a bit on the disappointing side , and I probably would not stay in this hotel again . It is a 5 star hotel , but more , a 4 star . \n",

      " Review:  Overall Good Value for the Money We enjoyed our stay , but we always make the best of a situation . I will just list the good and bad ( good first ) ; Breakfast wa good , lot of view of Diamond Head and the movie screen on the ( meaning decor , not renovated really ) Nice decor , fun , refrigerator in the Valet and One Front Desk clerk were super ! Nice seating option at the pool , nice lounging area , relaxing . ( Bad next ) : Service ( except the two mentioned ) no sense of , slow response time , wa TINY ( we had to upgrade ) . Two full size bed in a tiny closet of a room ( ) with four people , three over 5 ' 8 tall . It wa too small , the bathroom is tiny , can hardly turn around in it ! Watch the bartender at Tiki 's , they let some guy from charge his drink to my tab without asking me about it . Considering I had just arrived ( with my three kid ) it wa n't likely I wa buying drink for some in a bar . He eventually the charge , but seemed surprised that I did n't know the , slow service at the front desk , do n't be in a called for our luggage ( take yours up yourself ) and they said five to ten minute . We waited thirty and it still had not arrived , so after two call down ( and snotty clerk ) we just left . The luggage came sometime later while we were at pool wa small and most always very crowded . My ten year old would n't go in due to it being too are the type to always make the best of a situation , so we did . We had an enjoyable stay , it wa n't terrible , but I would n't be inclined to stay at that hotel again . However , I wa told that many of the hotel room are very small , I do n't know if this is to Del ( valet area ) and ( front desk ) we were taken care of . The rest of the staff were aloof and did n't really have any concept of customer note , FOR THE MONEY ( $ ) and the fact that it 's right across the road from the main beach , it 's a decent value for a nice location . We found most beach front location to be much more costly . It is a cute place , they have done some fun thing with the decor . There is easy access to food downstairs , Starbucks on the corner , ABC everywhere . Also , if you need service find a good front desk clerk , they helped u find a rental car when we were told none were available at all location we called . \n",

The food wa mediocre in quality but it certainly wa plentiful . The gift shop wa lovely and had a good variety of local . The beach wa beautiful . Contrary to what I had personally read about the beach being full of wa not our experience . There were men there daily the seaweed away . The view of the ocean wa breathtaking ! The pool wa great too , cool but when you were in the sunshine it wa just fine . The swim up bar wa fun and very friendly . Our room wa clean and tidy every day . The cleaning staff were very prompt and helpful ! We went to two of the ala carte . WE were not impressed with the Luna food . The staff we friendly and helpful ... the steak wa of very poor the rest of the food wa fine . The ( Italian ) wa fabulous . The staff were and friendly . We had the and it wa fabulous . We did not try La ( seafood ) a we had heard from other people from the that the seafood wa and not good tasting . Since we have easy access to seafood here in , we passed on that . We ca n't stay enough good stuff about Tony , Maria and Francisco ... bar staff and dining staff . Very helpful and fun people to have wait on you . We made fast friend with the staff and enjoyed all of their special attention to would recommend this resort for it beauty and it super friendly staff ! \n",

      " Review:  It wa awesome ! ! ! ! Well ... what can I say ? ? Do n't listen to the bad review ! ! Yes , this resort need to work on a few thing ... . for example . should not only be at , that cause a line almost to the door and you get a lot of unhappy guest . Security is ridiculous ! ! Almost everytime I walked towards my room they asked me my room number and if I wa carrying anything they would ask me what wa in the bag ... . for that kind of money I do n't want to be bothered with anything . Other than that everything wa so enjoyable . I came back today and I really wish I would 've booked it for longer . The walk from the room to the lobby are long but you 're on vacation . Enjoy the scenery ! ! This hotel is beautiful from it lobby to the pool to the room ... I am definetely going back next summer . I would recommend this hotel to anyone ! P.S . The food and drink are really expensive so to rent a car is a must ! ! ! Boston , \n",

      " Review:  Majestic - Fantastic ! Our first stay in the Majestic wa ! It wa mine and out partner first time with my parent . Well a we arrived at Punta cana , we were greeted by many happy staff at the airport . It took minute drive to the we arrived , we all recieved majestic cocktail , and a bell boy wa happy to take our bag for u . We did request a pool view ground floor 2 room next too , but we could n't get it a none were , We ended up being on 3rd floor garden view over the next resort . Then a couple of day later we were given the option to pay a 30 $ a night for a swim-up . My parent took it so that wa n't a are large , very clean , and very spacious with a bath , a big shower , and a toilet , and two sink ! We had a king size poster bed ! The bed were n't a comfortable a we were hoping for but thats it . There is a big tv which you can cover up and a mini-bar which is stocked daily . We also got little such a shampoo , conditioner , shower gel balcony had a table and two were impressed with the bar the swim-up bar ! There is a bar by the pool which there is a special mention we have to say to a member of staff ! ! thank you for the picture , we will put them up soon . We hope you 're kid enjoy the float ! ! and we will be coming back next year ! ! staff were always really friendly in all restaurant , despite if u did n't give them a tip ! The mexican restaurant me and my family thought were actually quite good there wa a lot of menu compared to most restuarants but either way good food , shame about the seafood wa really good , we were n't there twice .. i asked a member of staff which i should go for .. or he shrimp and they were gorgeous ! The steakhouse we went to for my partner suprise birthday party , that wa really good a there were petal on the table and they did a birthday cake for him , and sang aswell ! Le wa quite bad the first time , a the service wa bad and the manager kept walking around When the starter came , the came to top up our drink , but we were waiting for our for so long , then no , we noticed alot of other people waiting aswell . But the second time we went We had great service and the food wa much better . The main did go there for breakfast - great choice of and lunch wa really good dinner when we went out on night and it wa really good a they did great decor and everyone wa in the spirit of dressing up ! Food there wa pretty average but still a nice choice of food ! Beach agree with most people saying that the beach buffet wa pretty small but with very quick service ... a nice touch ! were actually quite dissapointed with this restaurant .. a on the menu they had a good selection but then did n't have some of the main course we asked for didnt bring out any noodle .. and when you were eating they ended up cleaning the surface which wa n't quite a nice sight . The chef wa n't really enthusiastic and did n't do any special trick . We decided not to try that one wa nothing special either , there wa n't alot of menu and the food wa The service wa OK pool wa very long with a cut in the wa two whirlpool spa area .. there wa never many screaming kid at all . And the chair you would probably have to get them at the early start a if you did n't go until there would n't be much wa always chair .. but at the time we were there , came about 4 wedding party and the beach up so you did have to book the seat that little bit earlier . The palm tree 's were a great touch aswell . The sea wa , there wa the odd occasion of hitting your foot on the rock but for a coral reef you can be white sand were so nice and a nice walk in the morning before breakfast is well worth it.We didnt end up viewing the show , a we were in the bar most of the time.The lobby wa really good aswell a there wa a small with computer . $ 5 for 30 min on the internet wa n't bad . There wa also a small cigar and shop , but we did n't go in them a told we could get cheaper outside the resort but from good are waiting till their sister resort which is to opening in a couple of week time ! !

( At the recommendation of our local sale office . ) It wa wonderful then and wa even more wonderful this time . Each interaction we had with the staff wa friendly and fast . The person travelling with me ( his first time to this hotel ) said he would definitely be back a well . Since we are both pet lover , the welcome sign for pet wa a nice touch -- even though our four friend were at home . It wa great to see people come through the lobby with their manager 's wine reception each evening allowed u to meet other guest . Each evening we ended up spending a long time talking with fellow traveler . The only problem wa we so long that dinner came quite late .

      " Review:  Great stay @ Novotel My husband and I have just returned from Bali on 14th July 08 . We booked the hotel from and for 3 night a they offered the lower price ( and including breakfast ) than the hotel official best rate . Our stay for the first night wa at Superior Room , across the street . We checked in at 9pm . The room wa spacious and clean . The toilet look relatively small though . We found that there wa no towel at all when we were about to shower . We called house keeping and they came with 2 bath towel quickly , yes just 2 bath towel , slightly though ( perhaps it鈥檚 more environment friendly by not using bleach ) . The wa somehow and stained . We called house keeping again . They came quickly with the entire set changed . I wa when I spotted a lizard near to the toilet door ! My husband managed to trap it , and we called the house keeping again to clean up the mess , . The superior room look slightly aged but it鈥檚 acceptable and comfortable for both of u . It鈥檚 one of the cheapest room in a 4-star hotel that I could find in Nusa Dua . We can鈥檛 complaint much about the ? smell of the room a Bali is a tropical area with high humidity , we are used to it anyway in checked out Superior room early next morning and headed to , thus leaving the hotel front desk to take care of our luggage . We returned to the hotel , obtained new room key to Tropical Terrace , and our luggage had already been placed in the room . The room wa huge , very clean , very new , very well lit , modern but with a touch of Balinese design . The room ha high ceiling , it air con is hidden in the ceiling and LCD TV with many international movie channel . There is small private garden that lead u to the room . We were absolutely happy with it a it look exactly like what you see on the hotel鈥檚 official breakfast includes , fried noodle , fried rice , sausage , fried potato , baked bean , mix cooked , soup , bacon , ham , cheese , bread , croissant , tropical fruit , cereal , yogurt , fruit juice , and fried egg . Yes , everyday you get almost the same stuff , with minor variation ( I expected , famous local spicy food , but wa told by husband that Balinese doesn鈥檛 eat that , too bad ) . We were happy with the tasty breakfast though.The Nusa Dua beach ha lot of seaweed unlike the clean Jimbaran beach however the hotel management did not really do the cleaning . There is always strong wind along the beach and it get chilly during morning and evening . We didn鈥檛 experience noisy water activity although we stayed pretty near to the beach . \n",

      " Review:  We felt like celebrity Gorgeous . My family and I stayed at the Hollywood hotel for 2 night and it wa the most memorable part of our trip to Hong Kong . On arrival back from China to Hong Kong we were picked up by Disneyland limo and dropped right at the door . As soon a we stepped out of the limo staff were there to take our bag . We walked up to the desk and were then suprised with an extra day free park ticket ! Check in wa easy and simple and we also exchange the rest of the chinese money we had left . We booked two room a we had 6 people ( 3 kid , 1 teen , 2 adult ) . At first I wa abit disapointed to be staying on the ground floor ( I wanted to ride in those , ! ) , but the room were amazing and the pool wa a short walk away . The ground there are simply stunning and we spent our last day there relaxing in style . The staff were so helpful and the pool wa gorgeous ! We must have spent 5 hour at the pool at least . It ha a , a ' ( spa ) , a bar , plenty of , shower , bathroom ( with toilet that are automatic flush , ) . Plenty to keep the kid entertained for hour while you relax after a long day at . also come swimming in the pool , great photo ! In the hotel there are 2 shop with exclusive and also 3 or 4 food place . The food wa the best at chef and if you are staying there the buffet dinner is with lot of western food and also alot of traditional is a hotel where you do n't want to get out of your room for the whole day . You could spend a day just at the hotel and I must say that having our last day in Hong Kong spent at the hollywood hotel relaxing wa the best day we had there . It felt great just to relax , yet also have some fun ! We went to to pick up the last few on our last day there and came back and chilled before the long flight back to shuttle bus from the hotel take you straight to the park and they run quite frequently . Overall , our trip to the hollywood hotel wa amazing . We were treated like celebrity every step of the way and nothing wa to must trouble . I really do n't know why this hotel ha so many bad review ! It is a must do on your trip to Hong Kong . I would not reccomend staying at the other hotel , we heard a few horror story from people we met around the park about it and to tell you the truth , it did n't look that appealing . Stay at the hollywood hotel , it is better than hollywood itself ! \n",

When I arrived , they told me that they were full because another party had decided to extend their stay , and so they booked me and about ten other convention attendee at another hotel . Though I thought the lack of a room wa , the situation wa handled reasonably well by the front desk staff . However , when I went back the next day for my room at noon ( they had said I would be scheduled for an earlier arrival ) , the Palomar told me that my room wa still being cleaned and to come back in a . Three hour later , at 3:00 pm , I wa again told to come back in a for my room . Finally , at about 5:00 pm , I wa given a room key . The room itself wa smallish but very nice . , yet attractive and comfortable . Great amenity , including some cool CD . Very nice bathroom , though the tub grout could use a good cleaning . They upgraded me to a room with a nice exterior view and sent a bottle of wine for my trouble , plus coupon for free breakfast every day . But I had to push for restaurant is intended primarily for dinner . They 'll serve you breakfast , but only -- the waitress in the morning have ton of attitude and were very cold . \n",

      " Review:  Do n't waste your time or money This hotel is a example of a Hilton Property . Prior to even arriving , I had multiple charge I 'd never agreed to on my credit card - a month in advance - for deposit that in no way to the room rate or the room rate + tax . It took four long phone call over two day to get this resolved . Upon arrival I discovered that there are two section - one renovated , one not . I 'd like to say - just make sure you ask for the renovated section but it wo n't help . My colleague and I had separate room in the renovated section . My room - the phone were and often cut out and the button did n't work . Housekeeping left trash on the floor , forgot to replenish thing like for coffee , and I placed a wake up call that never came . In my colleague room , the rug wa not put down properly and up in section , the shower did n't work properly , the sink sprayed water everywhere , In addition , she had a broken lamp that left the laying directly against the lamp shade . There is no fitness room - although it is listed on their website . There is a health club but you will have to pay an additional $ + tax charge to use it - so if you 're looking for just looking for a treadmill to workout in the morning , it 's going to get pricey . Customer service is - it took day for my colleague to get the issue with her room resolved - and even then it wa hardly satisfactory . I travel often and have stayed at many and similar hotel - this doe not meet the standard and there are far superior hotel in New Orleans within block of this one that will be far le problematic . \n",

      " Review:  is Definitely Not Better We were recently booked at Secrets Excellence , Punta Cana and were told le than 24 hour before departure that we had been bumped because Secrets had overbooked . They were putting u at the Melia Caribe and Resort for two night and then u to Secrets . For our trouble , we received a free week at Secrets , which make u extremely happy ! The Melia and Caribe is rated a a five star property in the brochure and definitely is beach , is of course beautiful . The location is good , only a half hour from the , any hotel with over room and employee can not provide a relaxing or intimate property is HUGE ! The very worst part is that you have to take a train to get from one area of the property to another i.e . the restaurant , bar , pool and beach . We often waited up to a half hour for this silly walking the wide sidewalk , be careful , a , van and truck regularly drive where guest are walking . What a noisy , and dangerous situation ! No one want traffic on a walkway on their , the food . It is not good . Breakfast wa fine , but we experienced two inedible dinner , one at the American Grill , where we were by loud , music and one at the buffet , where we ate , to say , we were to arrive at Secrets Excellence two day later and can not wait to return for our free week in paradise . \n",

      " Review:  K , , I am not overly picky , and ; I 've stayed and travel to enough place to offer a and objective opinion : ) I can sum it all up for those that do n't feel like reading my : Someone already wrote that if you can get a good rate ( not say , $ 79 ... go for it ) , and , i agree . But BEWARE , we were ... We were there during Mardi Gras , 7 night . Our room rate quoted when we made reservation , applied to only two of the night , during our stay ... then we were hit for an additional $ 70 for 5 of the night ... but of course not until we arrived ... and during Mardi Gras , well ... we had no choice , and they knew this hotel doe best is hype it self . The web sight designer for did a fantastic job , touching on all the element one might look for in an upscale hotel . The reality is that it is really just a mediocre property , a hotel go . The room are small , and desperately in need of updating ... though not dirty , stain from year gone by , abound . No superb bathroom ~ mediocre . The ~ mediocre . And here 's lame for you : No in-room coffe . They want you to order room service for it ... their out is that they offer free coffee in the lounge each morning ... but , who want to down to the lounge for free coffe ! ? AND the silly , small , cup are like a act , to your room ... try THAT after a night on the town ! The front desk staff , are ok ... not trained well , not very , well , welcoming ... They need a quick staff meeting to explain that customer service is what they do ... professional and friendly is a job requirement ... or switch to another department ... just . On an : the cleaning staff , and doorman were great . Back to low note : The in-house restaraunt , wa empty . Though I can not comment it 's quality , that is pretty telling , especially during Mardi Gras , when we were there . In contrast : I can not say enough great thing about the greasy spoon a we call them here , across the street from the , where we went for breakfast each morning ... The wa a diner style dining ! They treated u like Family , and the food wa , well ... Mom made the biscuit and , , , said ... simply great folk , great food . We went to Mother 's ( this is a very popular type place , one morning ... very popular , long line ... But , having done both , The is where it 's at . Back to : up again , if you get that $ 79 rate ( each night you 're there ) , go for it . Otherwise , right across the street is the Omni , or do the JW Marriot ... or do your research , and find true boutique Hotel , with a higher standard of style , and service ... is simply mediocre at best . \n",

      " Review:  Beautiful beach at Iberostar Bavaro My husband and I spent our 17 yr anniversary at Iberostar Bavaro , 2005 . Every year since our marriage we have traveled during this time . We booked our trip through Apple vacation , which ha directed u towards some of the best resort in the Carribean and Mexico over the year . We were at Secrets Excellence in DR 2 yr ago , so Iberostar had a tough act to follow , a we absolutely loved Secrets - no child , great staff , beautiful room , good food drink . Although we had no serious complaint about Iberostar and we enjoyed a relaxing week in a tropical setting , here 's the plus and minus : The lobby and ground are truly beautiful . , peacock , and bird everywhere . They did a spectacular job with the lighting at night . The suite are nice , and they provide a big jug of bottled water in the . The food is good , and the freshly baked croissant are warm and tasty in the morning along with your omelet . You must have patience , however , to wait to make reservation for dinner . It 's an extremely slow process , so make them all at once . And do n't forget to take the slip of paper with you to the dinner or you 'll be turned away ! Japanese wa our favorite . The paella with lobster is the best choice in the restaurant . The Mexican wa so-so , because the salsa taste like pure and the air conditioning wa barely working . My husband thought the nightly buffet wa really great , and no reservation needed . One night they had grilled lobster , which wa awesome . The casino is a fun evening option to the show which we 've grown bored with . I won $ USD playing roulette the first night , but you do have to watch the girl closely because I caught them twice clearing the table of winning bet . The beach is one of best we 've been to ... soft , white sand , wide and long enough to take you a far a your leg can walk , plenty of beach chair and , and fun people watching a there is the most international crowd I 've seen . Sometimes that became a negative for me , a I wa to talk to someone who spoke English while my husband went ( though he enjoyed the Cocotal golf course , the price are way ! ) . I definitely felt in the minority vs. Europeans . And it is no that about 10 % of the woman are topless on the beach , so beware if you have child . The pool area is very nice , with one section zero depth like a beach , another over 6 ft deep , another for small child , and another for the swim-up bar . We did not spend much time at the pool bar , a the atmosphere is different when you have kid all around . And a for the drink , I wa not impressed . All the tropical mix are overly sweet , and if you forget to ask for alcohol with your or pina colada , you 'll get a virgin drink . Only local booze is on the counter , and it wa tough to get the premium liquor . One night I asked for tonic , and wa told that they ran out of a well a champagne ! Who is these bar ? ! Although this resort is all-inclusive , I truly felt like I got low grade liquor unless we tipped . I never experienced this at Secrets or at a Sandals resort . Also to note wa that I waited til the last day to tip our maid ( though she smiled genuinely and thanked me ) -- -we did not get fresh flower in our room each day , nor towel rolled up a decoration , like other reviewer mentioned . So , if this make your stay , I suggest early tipping is in order at Iberostar . For these subtle difference , Secrets Excellence is a better choice in DR for adult traveling without kid , though Iberostar is a very nice resort with good thing to offer . \n",

Having a wife that work in a hotel , the first thing we usually do is strip the bed of the blanket since , if you 're not aware , those thing only get washed every few month and are absolutely disgusting at most hotel . Not so at Marriotts and a few other hotel that have switched to this of bedding . Regardless , everything else wa fantastic . The concierge and the bellman were very professional .

      " Review:  Sunscape Punta Cana Grand : What a beautiful vacation ! ! ! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand from June 18th to the 23rd . We had a wonderful time ! The resort is a mix of family and couple ; it is not a wild , crazy , party place . We are both in our early 20 's and had a great time ! There wa always something for u to do , or a place to just sit and relax if that 's what we wanted to do . The review worried me about so many thing , but I wa not disappointed once down there . The restaurant are great , however you are not in America , keep that in mind . Things are not made the same there a they are here . The buffet wa really good , a well a Da Mario 's . every morning , and a steak almost every night ! One night they had an outside buffet by the theatre , the food wa good there a well . We sadly missed the beach buffet , a we left Thursday afternoon . You never had to get up at crazy hour in the morning to a chair . ' There were plenty for everyone . We were in building 3 , third floor and had no problem with bug , damp sheet , or funny smell . Sure if you went out on the balcony , there were some ant , but what do you expect being ? ! There were certainly no rat anywhere . I do n't know what these other people are talking about . The staff wa amazing , you saw them early in the morning , and late at night doing something else . They were always there to help you a quickly a possible with anything . Our favorite part of the resort wa Juan , the pool bartender . He had new drink for u before we were halfway through the one in our hand ! The 's were the best ! ! The little sandwich by the pool were a nice afternoon snack . The pool wa warm sometimes , but you are right next to the , it happens . The beach never smelled like gas , and did n't have a lot of seaweed laying around like some have said . It wa fun to barter with the people in the hut on the beach . They can get pushy , but all you have to do is say no thank word of advice I would like to pas along is ... not book through Liberty Travel ! ! ! They were not helpful or accomodating to u AT ALL ! ! ! We ran into so many unnecessary problem because of them . I will never again use that travel agency , and will warn anyone I know not to a well . I can not wait to return to Punta Cana , and I will definitely go back to the Sunscape Grand ! ! ! \n",

      " Review:  Okay We recently spent 4 night at the Crowne Plaza in Beverly Hills . The entrance and lobby are nicely done and well maintained , but the room are a little tired . Not bad for the price , but do n't expect too much . The heated pool wa even too cold for my kid and the hot tub had a green color to it and about 6 inch of foam on top . We stayed clear . The parking lot wa reasonable for the area at $ 12 per day with and tried the breakfast buffet one morning - it wa a little pricy - about $ 13 for an adult and $ 6 for child . It wa the typical buffet that you could find for probably half that wa surprised that there wa not much to do in the immediate area for a family , except look at some shop on Beverly and Rodeo . You need to drive or take a cab to get anywhere - at that take a long time . \n",

There are 2 side to this resort , the le expensive , which is older side , but closer to the beach and more restaurant . And then there is the Reserve , which is their brand new luxury suite that just recently opened . The decor is gorgeous , Punta Cana beach is stellar on a sunny day . On the reserve side it is a bit of a walk to get to the beach , or you have to wait for a tram if you do not want to walk . The food definitely need to be improved and the service is hit or miss . the food and service and this could be a 5 star All inclusive resort experience . \n",

      " Review:  Fantastic ! We stayed at this hotel August . I have got to say that if you can not afford to stay at George V ( where I always get my hair done when in Paris ) then this is THE hotel to stay at . We arrived a few hour early and we were checked in immediately a the room wa already prepared . The front desk staff is the friendliest and nicest and always ready to help with anything . , , and ( and the late night desk clerk ) were the greatest ! They arranged to have someone pick u up at the airport , made restaurant reservation for u , and gave u info and help for just about anything we needed . They spoke perfect English and I learned so much about how to get around in Paris from them . And you can order Louvre ticket and the Paris hop off bus ticket right there at the front desk and save a lot of time ! Also , the location is great - only a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower . My son even did laundry at the around the corner - the washer cost but the dryer are free . The neighborhood ha little market , restaurant , etc . - VERY convenient . The hotel room wa a decent size for a boutique hotel - In other word , we could unpack our suitcase and leave them sit out , not all up a in other boutique hotel . And the bathroom wa just like being in an American hotel - very nice and roomy with lot of amenity , even shoe shine . The air conditioning and everything worked great . The lobby is so nice and cozy and they have book and game sitting out and a little bar - it is just like being in your own den back home . My family will always stay at this hotel now that we have discovered it . It is the best . \n",

The Majestic is only a couple of year old so it is very clean . They all aim to please you . They have a great crew a people there to make sure you have whatever it is you need . One of my favorite gal is . She u from last year . She work at guest service . When she saw u she wa so happy ! I did n't think she would u but she did . We had our bed turned down every night with rose petal on it . We had a special delivery everyday to our room . Such a cheese and fruit tray one day . Then we had a bottle of wine with sushi etc etc . The beach is one of the most magnificent beach we have ever been to . We have been to , Mexico , and St. Lucia many time at different resort and this place ha it all ! The pool is wonderful a well . There are quite place to go or if you want to mingle with others there is that a well . The food is good . My husband is a steak lover so they have really good steak . Me , I 'm a pasta person there are all pasta station with all kind of sauce for it . Well all I can say is that we are getting ready to book our vacation back there . We love it ! ! ! ! ! \n",

Having been to NYC a few time , this wa by far the best hotel and indeed location . We were greeted with slick and friendly staff who checked u in quickly and could not do enough to help u throughout our 4 day stay.We stayed in a Deluxe room which wa excellent , minimal and top quality in every way . A luxurious feel bathroom with Brown product and load of space throughout . The hotel wa extremely quiet particularly for such a central Town location , it wa a haven from the craziness outside . The Hotel 's Bar wa a great place to start your evening with once again great term of location it could n't have been better , walking distance from all the Town sight and sound , a Subway station 30 second away to easily get around the rest of Manhattan , and by the lovely Bryant Park itself . Overall we could not fault anything , it wa an excellent trip , NYC wa a exciting a ever , and the Bryant Park Hotel wa simply spot on , we will definitely be going back there . \n",

The room wa never . a banana sat on the counter for 4 . I wa from their only public center which wa used a the for their restaurant . This wa done without a posted notice and with no regard to basic hospitality practice . Left without a place where to charge my laptop I wa forced to a conference call from the nearest . This wa done after I had checked out early a a courtesy to the hotel to allow them to prepare room during a very busy I left towel in the shower floor to be replaced only to find the same pile and new towel on top of my side . I waited in the pub to be acknowledged or sat down for 20 minute . Nobody even made eye contact with hotel doe not effectively cater to the business travel . managed and a shame to the Club Quarters organization \n",

      " Review:  hated it , sorry : ( It wa nice to be away from and the cold weather but my girlfriend and i hated the guess we 've been spoiled with other place because we did n't like this had a GREAT time because we were away in the sun , , but compared to other place it just wa n't very good.I think our main problem wa , it wa just to big . People . This place ha over 1000 room where most resort have food stunk . I 'm a big eater and not very picky , but it wa awful . Sure the salad , ice cream , pasta , and breakfast wa great . But the meat wa terrible compared to the Hilton beach is much nicer than , but this resort wa just to big for our liking . People , very main pool ha a which is nasty . I refuse to go in any pool with a bar . You see old men drinking for 6 hour and not moving ... like to swim with urine ? I 've heard many horror story about swim up pool ... . \n",

      " Review:  Had a great stay at Kimpton Fisherman 's Wharf Argonaut , Kimpton at Fisherman 's Wharf , San Francisco , wa wonderful ! The hotel is nautical themed and very new with good quality and comfortable furnishing . It ha a called the Blue that is very good and reasonable and serf breakfast , lunch and dinner . They have an evening wine hour in the lobby that wa a highlight for u . Upon check-in , the front desk person called it a wine tasting , but it wa clearly a generous wine pouring event . The lobby is big but ha a very cozy feel with a large fireplace and wa nice to enjoy in the evening . We bought a deal that wa very inexpensive in city term and included parking , breakfast , and trolly pass . The staff wa always very helpful . We had a fabulous time and we will be back ! \n",

      " Review:  Outstanding small hotel The Charlesmark Hotel could not be better situated . In the heart of Boston 's Back Bay directly above the Copley Square subway station , it 's in easy walking distance of the whole of the centre of the City . The hotel ha recently a major refurbishment and , although the room are small ( even by European standard ) , they are very well appointed . The bathroom are particularly : the finish is not only very practical but also very attractive . The room in which we stayed had a double bed and a sofabed . We used both . The sofabed - never the most piece of furniture - wa of decent quality and totally satisfactory for the three night duration of our stay . The inclusive continental breakfast wa a plus , a wa the free internet access from terminal in the bar arriving in the city by air , ignore the of the to catch the silver line bus from Logan Airport into the centre . Instead , take the airport shuttle # 33 from the terminal to the blue line subway station , changing to the green line at Centre station . The journey from the airport terminal to the hotel front desk by this route will take you no more than 30 minute . If arriving in the city by from the South , the hotel is barely 5 minute ' walk from the Back Bay train station . \n",

      " Review:  Nice tidy hotel ... you 'll need the metro ! The hotel wa a little outside of the town , and I had to show a map to the taxi driver ! impression were : clean , modern and high quality . Staff were very helpful , and spoke pretty good English ( not to be ! ) were clean , and looked modern . The wall were a bit on the thin side , and being woken by drunken people returning from La Ramblas late at night wasnt amusing : No 24hr room service , and a distinct lack of choice on the restaurant menu . The waiter were very laid back , and waiting 10 min for some service at the cafeteria wasnt . Although we did go late June , and the hotel wasnt that clean pool on the top of the hotel , I 'm suprised this wasnt even mentioned ! Very close to the Del Mar metro station , and this proved to be very useful when travelling to and from the though , I think I would have to recommend the hotel . Its inconvenient location is by the proximity of the metro station ( Euro = single to the centre ) , and the hotel wa in very good shape , let down only slightly by the service from the out of 5 \n",

      " Review:  Xmas In Amsterdam We ( me my wife ) stayed in this hotel from Xmas eve for 4 night and it served u perfectly . The advice given on this site by other reviewer regarding requesting a room at the back of the hotel , wa spot on . We got such a room ( ) which did look out over the back and it wa lovely and peaceful . The front of the hotel look out over Rembrandt Sq , which would have been very noisy at time and doe have load of light . Our room wa excellent for the two of u , being recently redecorated , with a comfy king sized bed and with good bathroom . The hotel staff were all very helpful ( even though they were working over holiday ! ) and the breakfast wa very nice too . The Breakfast bar/restaurant is a fine sight , with lot of lovely old . All told , the picture on the hotel web site really do it justice . Best thing of course , wa the excellent location of the hotel . It wa wa in easy walking distance of all the main attraction . I would also recommend Amsterdam a an excellent Xmas destination , a all the museum , bar restaurant ( but not the shop ) are open all day . Walking around the deserted canal , on a bright sunny day wa a true joy . The exchange rate made eating and drinking a bit steep but that 's not Amsterdam 's fault . \n",

      " Review:  Great Beach Hotel with Nice Many people are not very happy with the Modern Miami architecture of the . However , I found it to be very retro and fun . The hotel 's beach is located on is quite lovely and it had a nice resort feel . The hotel ha a beautiful lobby . I think it is worth it to get an oceanfront view room . Yes , the room are slightly old-fashioned in their layout but overall clean , large and nicely . The elevator are a little slow but other than that I found it to be a great value . Those who are use to modern and newly constructed hotel should head to the more expensive hotel like the Mandarin Oriental . You ca n't expect the Ritz Carlton when one is paying anywhere from $ a night to $ . I think this is a great hotel for family . \n",

We had flight problem in transit from Aruba to Toronto and our flight landed in Punta Cana where all passenger were put for one night at the Punta Cana Resort our recent travel ha mostly been to Aruba we have stayed in many Caribbean destination over the past 20 n't go back to this one if it wa paid ! The room would have been ok IF it wa n't full of bug ( huge spider and hundred of mosquito ) , if the air conditioner did n't sound like a machine gun , if the food at the buffet had been OR front desk called u 4 time between midnight and 5 a.m. with a wake up call that we never requested . We set the alarm for 5 a.m. We did n't need a wake up call at 1 a.m. to confirm they would be waking u at 5 a.m. ! Between the call , the noise of the A/C , and the bug there wa no possibility for sleep . The next morning when we all in the lobby to go back to the airport for our travel home , almost every passenger had complaint of light , AC , television , and an wide array of local wildlife in the room . Also , it seemed every passenger got multiple wake up call including 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. to confirm the 5 a.m. wake-up call . Not one passenger I spoke with indicated they 'd asked for any wake-up call believe most of u were in the villa or casitas - maybe in the larger building thing would have been better . We did not sleep or eat at this all-inclusive property but we would have liked to do both . Just wa n't possible . \n",

      " Review:  Disappointing Let me this by saying that my fiancee and I are very laid back people , we do n't complain about a lot , and although we enjoy 5 star service we arent picky traveller because we can have fun anywhere . That said , the Gran Melia wa not a good experience for u . We just got engaged and this wa a weekend away to celebrate that , we just went Saturday to Monday over the Columbus Day weekend . Upon arriving the hotel is so beautiful and the ground look so nice that you couldnt imagine taking any issue with the place but we experienced so many problem with the service that we couldnt ignore it any checking in there wa only 1 person at the huge desk and we stood there for about 15 while she took care of the people in front of u ( who seemed to have had a problem . ) Then we walked to our which wa a an ocean front suite but we couldnt even see what minimal beach there wa from our room . The room wa not very nice either . It wa big , but it wa decorated , the bed were uncomfortable and the second night there wa a pillow on the bed that had no pillow case on it and had dried blood first night we went to , their on site restaurant , it wa very good and fun . a glass of sake and they fill it up to the top like it 's a glass of wine ! The next night we went to the Italian place , , but my fiancee is so picky when it come to food and all of the italian dish had some sort of a seafood twist to them so we left and ordered room service , this wa the worst of it . The room service took 1 1/2 hour to get to our room , and when we called after 45 minute to see what wa taking so long they took our order again a if they didnt have it in the first place , I had already fallen asleep and then when it got to u it wa the wrong order and we 'd been charged for thing we didnt even get ! We also tried to make reservation both night for the restaurant and couldnt get through to the restaurant or reservation either night . On the whole the manager seemed very helpful , the porter and the concierge but the other staff just honestly didnt seem to give much of a thought to the guest . A few time while trying to get towel for the pool we had to wait for the young girl to get off of her personal cell phone . I believe that this hotel used to be an all inclusive or still partially is and the staff still ha the all inclusive , that you 've already paid for it so they dont have to do much more for you.The last issue I had wa the Royal Service part of the hotel . It cost a lot more to get the Royal Service and you get a butler and there 's a separate pool , etc . It just seems a if they it , you cant go to the pool which is much nicer , calmer and ha a private bar ( it 's trying to get anything from the pool bar and the not good . ) It just seems like the people who pay for Royal Service dont get perk , they get a whole separate experience . It wa very to say the , like I said , Im not one to complain , all of my other trip advisor review have been positive but I really would stay away from this resort , it ha a lot of work to do ! \n",

There is basically no lobby on the first floor , but who want one on Times Square ? The room are in size , and all have ceiling fan and style furnishing . I like the ease of the window air conditioner and enjoyed a quiet room on the with window I could open with no issue . Rick 's is the breakfast and drink room on the second floor and it is comfortable and friendly with flat screen TV 's and free wine and beer each afternoon . The best thing about the place is the staff . They are always available , helpful , and pleasant . They all speak English and seem to enjoy their job . The guy at the desk helped u get limo and got u a room for part of day so we could check out in the is a feel to the place , but the staff and quirky room make it feel authentic .

The location is perfect , and literally adjacent to the aquarium subway prevent confusion : I had seen some other review that said daily maid service wa an extra fee . This is only if you are using timeshare point to pay for your room . If you reserve through the marriott website and pay a nightly rate , there is free maid service just like any other hotel . \n",

      " Review:  Nice But ... . This is a hotel designated a a Historic Hotel of America and I wo n't argue with that but be warned that this is a building needing a bit of a renovation . The service of the staff wa fine however walking to our room I wa kind of struck by the smell of the hallway . The room wa nice , although being over Market St we at time felt like the traffic and street sound were in our room . Light sleeper beware ! The bathroom wa big and had the look of having been partially renovated in the 70 . The loose tile , mildew on the made you think a newer renovation wa due . Lastly , and other have said this , Market Street at this spot in particular is n't pretty . Having to the panhandler each day wa a hassle and in the evening seeing an obvious prostitute hanging in front of the entrance kind of made me . I recommend that if you have a choice stay in a SF neighborhood away from downtown . Public transportation is great in SF and that is where SF look and feel best . \n",

We got a walk-in rate of dollar for a large room facing Diamond Head . Although , the view to the ocean wa limited we were not bothered by the music coming from the pool ( where a band played every day and night ) a the pool wa on the other side of the hotel . I do n't think the noise would have been a problem anyway , since the band stop playing early in the evening and the pool closed at room wa large and clean . The size of the bathroom wa good . The room wa cleaned every day , towel were also replaced daily . The breakfast included in the room rate wa a nice bonus . The breakfast wa okay , nothing fancy but still enough the money we paid for the room , you could not ask for a better location . The beach is just across the street . Also , the hotel is at the east end of Waikiki , which made it a le noisy place to sleep . The beach across the street wa never full either although it wa the spring break , we were very pleased with the hotel . We would definitely stay at this hotel again . \n",

      " Review:  Had a great time at Breezes We just returned yesterday from our stay at Breezes , Punta had our two son age 13 and 11 with u . I wa very pleased with the resort . I wa a little worried after reading some of the review . We arrived at about 10 pm and were in our room within 15 minute . Building 5 had a great view of the pool and some of the water and wa n't far from anything . As someone mentioned , it is a good idea to bring some of your own towel from home to your beach chair . We found that we had to save our chair by the pool and between 5:30 and 6am if we wanted so sit somewhere specific . a by the beach is a great idea a they go quickly and the sun get very hot . Also recommended is cup to hold your drink , to wash out your bathing suit , candy to give the local child if you go on the Bavaro Runners tour . We really enjoyed the Bavaro Runners tour . You got to see a little of everything in one day . We went to a sugar cane plantation , a cigar factory , Dominican woman , horseback riding and a private beach . It wa interesting to see what life wa like outside the resort . My boy had a great time meeting and playing with kid from all over the world . There wa a list posted by the pool with the day activity . We also enjoyed the animation crew , especially , Julio , Jamaica . They work from morning to night running game , dance and exercise clinic for kid and adult . My only wish is that they had better food . We have been to Punta Cana before , and the food always taste different than what were used to . My kid lived on roll and french fry all week . My husband and I both got sick one night but a little Immodium took care of it . The beach wa the most beautiful I had ever seen . Yes it wa but the kid loved it . We brought blow up inner tube from home for $ 3.00 from and they body with them all day . Be aware that the beach is topless . A little odd to see at first , but after a day or so you no n't even care . All in all we had a great time and would recommend Breezes a a good 4 star resort . \n",

      " Review:  We loved this place My wife and I just returned from a week at Secrets ( ) . We went prepared for the worst after reading some of the negative post here , so let me address those thing first . The bumpy road : there is one stretch of a mile or two where it 's pretty bumpy , but it 's nothing remotely dangerous . Anyone who make a big deal out of the road is just . The bug : yeah , I got bit 3 or 4 time one night when I did n't use bug spray . My wife never used it and never got bit . The food : you 'll find some bad food but you can also find a lot of good food . The ocean : it is a little rough , but a others have said , walk to the right along the beach past the point and you 'll find water suitable for the good stuff . The people : truly friendly and helpful . They do n't all speak English , but they all try hard to please you . The ground : breathtaking . The pool and beach are spectacular . The room : we had your garden view room in building . It wa great . Ask for the third floor so you can get the cathedral couple of other thing . Thanks to at Go Away Travel for arranging our trip and getting u our requested room with a couple of freebie thrown in ( massage , turn-down service , etc ) . And by all mean stay away from the Super game at the casino . Secrets should be ashamed to host this game and the guy who run it . They know it 's a rip-off ( the Apple rep warned u about playing it on the way in ) so why not just get rid of it ? Bottom line : if you 're thinking of going to Secrets , do n't let the you . You 'll like this place a lot . \n",

      " Review:  Not up to American standard - but still nice enough Ok , Ok - I know I 'll probably get by saying not up to American standard ... but this would not be a 4 star hotel in the state . I travel a lot to Europe -- so I do know this is a nice hotel with pretty spacious room compared to most hotel . The is a chain of hotel owned by the Swiss and it reflects the Swiss charm nicely - very clean and sleek ( think upscale ) . My problem included VERY spotty service from the staff ( some where knowledgable , some had no clue -- including the concierge ! ) An example - on one day I asked about the tram and wa told that the shuttle did n't run except on the half hour and you needed a reservation . That seemed very odd to me -- that you would need a reservation for public transport . So I asked again , in a different manner ( I thought perhaps a language barrier ) and then wa told OH -- you mean the . -- yes , it doe run often -- he pointed out the tram station ( about a block away ) and off I went . So he had jumped to the conclusion that I wanted the hotel shuttle and gave me wrong info . Later that day a co-worker ( I wa there with a large convention ) told me you could get a public transportation pas and/or a strip ticket -- so you could ride the tram often , and at a lower price . ( Why had n't the concierge offered that earlier ? ) So I went to go buy one and wa told that no , they did n't sell them . Luckily , another staff member overheard u and that now they DID sell them . So I went to the front desk and bought one from him . Later that day , another co-worker had the same experience . Other problem - our towel had in them ! The bed linen were never changed ( and we were there for a week ! ) I complained 2x to no avail . One of the day I did not receive my wake up call . The next day I got of them ! ! 2 of my had reservation -- ( we had confirmation in writing , thank goodness ) -- but they hotel had them on the wrong day ( started a day late ) . They tried to tell me that it wa full and nothing could be done -- but when I wa firm -- they were able to find room ( had to upgrade one co-worker -- and wanted to charge u -- but I refused ) . But my shy co-worker ( these 3 were from the Republic ) would have taken this crap if I wa n't there to insist . Other thing : the phone system wa a bit hard to use ( no instruction on the phone , the info in the wa wrong ) . No easy way to call room service or get your message . ( My co worker phone were all different -- some were ok , some not -- again , very varied in the way thing work ! ) . The gym wa nice but while they offered service ( massage ) -- I could not schedule one to save my life . The maid sometimes left new and sometimes did not . ( Why ? Why the ? ? ) . . , etc . Anyway -- I hope the management read this and the comment form I filled out ( but I had the feeling it wa being the moment I turned it in ... there wa n't a safe place to it that I could see ... ) and work out these kink . On the positive side -- the food is delicious . Its not at city center ( can be a plus ) but easy to use tram 25 or 26 , canal boat , or taxi ( and the shuttle if you make a reservation ) . The conference crew wa quite good ( Simone and Peter made my life VERY easy during this week ) . It is clean and quiet . The little gym wa nice ( but be aware that the sauna are , clothing optional ! ) \n",

      " Review:  Location , Location , Location Located between Times Square and 5th Avenue and only 15 minute walk to Central Park . Only a couple of block from 42nd street and Broadway . This is the place to hotel itself is perfect and deserves it high ranking . Anyone who give it a poor review ha probably simply had bad luck . The room are massive - and we only had the Queen room . The TV is the best I have seen in a hotel . and ha a massive choice of free TV which is good when waiting for the to get ready . The bathroom is massive and ha separate bath and shower . The photo speak for themselves I mini bar is one of those that charge you if you take anything out which the fridge useless . But the price are bar and restaurant offer very good service with , helpful staff . I would n't normally eat in the hotel when on holiday but this wa worth it.I would n't stay anywhere else in NY . \n",

      " Review:  Perfect Florence Hotel Perfect hotel located in the area ( 1 block from the Arno River ) . If you are interested in staying in a beautiful palace in the somewhat le traveled area where most are by local there are craft shop etc this would be an ideal choice . From the moment you enter the you know you are in for a first class stay . her staff make sure that you lack for nothing the entire time . My wife I were fortunate in that we were able to stay in the junior suite ( the wall ceiling are covered with beautiful ) that ha a private terrace , large bathroom you walk through a garden to enter it from the lobby . Our room wa the smallest it wa still the largest room we had in our 15 day stay in Italy . A first class breakfast is served in an exquisite room on an upper floor . There is a rooftop terrace that ha view of the entire city of lucky enough to stay in a 15th century palace with all room being unique , well furnished very large helped make our stay in Florence perfect . We could not imagine returning to Florence not staying here . \n",

      " Review:  Stylish but good value hotel in central Tokyo I stayed here for three night on business in November 2006 . Great hotel for the price - if I were to come back for a holiday I would choose to stay here again . English speaking staff greeted me the moment I walked into the lobby on the 25th floor and asked if I needed to check in , also offered to help with anything after they had showed me to my room . I really liked the atmosphere in the lobby with the area . I stayed here on my own which sometimes a a woman can be a bit and intimidating . But here I felt very at home - due to the helpful staff and mix of guest : some preparing for tomorrow 's presentation over a beer , some tourist , some Japanese ( but not many ) . The French Restaurant , run by chef , deserves a mention . I entertained 5 Japanese here and the staff were very helpful in setting it up , providing special menu , etc . The food is good french cuisine ' - beware , the portion size are quite small so I think my Japanese colleague felt a bit and ate lot of bread . The food is good but not great - this restaurant would not get a star ( although the chef 's Paris restaurant ha one ) . And my room had a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower - what more could you ask for ? \n",

      " Review:  Above Average , But Not Much My wife and I stayed for 3 night . The location is not great for tourist . All of the tourist zone require either a cab ride or a subway ride , although 2 metro station are convenient to the hotel . As for the hotel itself , it is huge . Just getting from the room to an exit take 10 minute at a good pace . However it may be worth it if you want a view of Tokyo . The tower ha 40 story . The size of the hotel also mean that it is very crowded . On the flip side , the service wa good , from the housekeeping , to the front desk to the concierge . The bed wa comfortable and the bathroom wa nicely appointed . An english language newspaper wa delivered daily . There are numerous restaurant , but they are terribly expensive . The hotel ha a pool , but you have to pay extra to use it.We paid about $ US per night , which wa a fair price for the hotel . \n",

From the moment we arrived employee were u to take u to buy thing for which they would get - totally . even tried to sell you shampoo from your bathroom ! The restaurant , which is advertised a great , wa completely mediocre , and the service wa sub-par - served by dirty and server . Perhaps I wa spoiled by all of the other great hotel I stayed at during my trip , but this hotel definitely wa the worst , by far , and it wa not cheap . The ground were not well kept , it wa noisy , with tourist lounging about everywhere - no privacy . Just gross . Do not stay here , you can do much better . Plus , not too much to do in .

      " Review:  Home away from home A stay at the Clarendon Hotel and Suites is simply the best . Having to be in Phoenix at least 3 time a month for more than several day at a time can be challenging . The hotel ha become a second home for u and I do mean home . The management and staff are very freindly a well a accomodating to one need . You will be greeted with a friendly hello when you arrive , a good morning at the beginning of the day , and a thank you for staying with u when you checkout . This is a very hip and modern hotel and the room are extremely comfortable and clean . I love the fact that the hotel ha a non smoking policy in all room ! The hotel ha an awesome pool and Jacuzzi area . For me , being a music lover , the hotel play music all day in the pool area , Jazz , , and . This hotel is owned and it is very evident that they have a hand on approach to detail . They work very hard to make your stay a positive and comfortable stay . We have met people from all over the world staying at the Clarendon . The Clarendon Hotel is truly an Oasis in the Desert . 24 hour a day you can count on The Clarendon Hotel to be an awesome hotel . , and Chris \n",

The people at the front desk were helpful , polite , and professional . My room wa very clean and comfortable . I have stayed at some fine hotel in my lifetime . Many of those should send their employee to this hotel to learn how it 's done . I walked across the street to a shopping center to get dinner ( several restaurant , , 2 ) and walked a block to St. 's for Sunday morning . Also took another walk that morning . I am a woman traveling alone and felt very safe . The free breakfast wa n't anything to write home about but wa adequate . The price wa reasonable for Miami . \n",

      " Review:  Awesome recommend ! ! ! We stayed at the Ocean Blue Golf and Beach resort from to . I booked this hotel because I thought the price wa great . However , I had read many bad review about it so I wa concerned that I would be disappointed . I decided to read review about the top of the line resort in Punta Cana and it seems that no matter what , there will always be someone who ha a problem with where they stay . So with that in mind , I booked this hotel and hoped for the booked the package deal through . The transportation wa ready for u at the airport . We waited a few minute for other passenger . We were the first to be dropped off at our hotel . Check in wa quick and we were off to our rooms.The room were clean and very well kept . The jacuzzi tub had stain that I thought were dirt . I tried to clean it off myself and thats when I figured out they were stain . There were also 3 hair in the tub . food at the buffet hotel wa good and it had lot of variety . The wait staff wa always prompt with drink service . We were always able to get into the other restaurant with no problem . One day there wa a 30 minute wait for the Italian restaurant . We would have waited but my husband wa feeling a little sick that day so we went to the buffet restaurant instead . That worked out because he wa able to enjoy some amazing Dominican dancing show were okay . I think they are similar to the quality of show on a cruise . Its no broadway show , but for being included in the price they were entertaining and gave u something to do at night.The Wave Disco wa fun . The dancer from the theatre show go and try to get the crowd dancing . The bowling alley is tiny and it is tough getting a lane at night . I think there were only 6 lane . Instead , we played and upstairs from the pool were large and I do n't know if it wa because we went at a slow time of year but there were not many people in the pool . Most of those that were in the pool were at the swim up bar . We felt like we had the whole pool to ourselves most one of the photographer from the in the hotel found u at the beach and took picture of u . He wa very nice and had u do silly , fun pose . We loved 3 of the photo he took of u and bought them for $ 8 are excursion people around the resort who will you a you walk by . We booked the ATV excursion with Daniel from tour . The excursion wa great . They were running late which wa a little annoying but once we got on the ATV 's , we all had a great time . We also booked the speed cat excursion through the hotel 's staff . That wa a lot of fun . We were the only one on the tour so we got to spend more time doing the thing we enjoyed like sliding down the 40 ft slide that we stopped at . We also stopped at a sand bar far in the ocean to swim . I did n't like that too much so we got moving again after a few were a lot of little thing that were bad about the hotel but I think we would have run into a lot of the same thing no matter where we stayed . The problem were not enough to make u regret booking this hotel.I would definitely bring a for the room a most other traveler have mentioned the bad lighting in the room . Thankfully we had one lamp that had a great bulb . I had to wonder if that wa done by a fellow HIGHLY recommend this resort . If I ever go back to Punta Cana I would most definitely stay there again . If you have booked this resort and are second your decision , dont worry . It 's an awesome resort and you will enjoy your stay . \n",

      " Review:  Overrated ! I must agree with an earlier review about the service . My wife and I stayed for four night but had originally booked for five . When we advised we would be leaving a day earlier than planned , it wa handled a a major . Despite being a few metre away , the Manager with me about this problem by email ... ! ! ! He informed me that I would be charged for all night booked , despite my planned early departure ! Now I appreciate that some country house and resort hotel have such a , but this hotel is in the city of Sydney and they are also charging the same rate a most five star Sydney hotel . I wa also staying for several night and gave them plenty of notice of the change . I found the ( ! ! ) and after a heated , I eventually got some satisfaction and wa not charged for the early departure . However , it is important that people are aware that this is not a hotel to stay at if you are in Sydney on business and there is any chance that you may have to make a change to your reservation . The only other point I would make is that when we arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a 24hr flight from London , there wa no one to greet u and I had to call an after hour number to get in . I wa given security code instruction for the front door and told my key wa in the room . We then had to carry four large suitcase up a flight of stair with no ha an excellent hip location in Point , somewhat for a most hotel ! However , I would not stay there again due to the attitude , policy and service problem . You can enjoy the same style and character of hotel at THE in a very pleasant and historic part of the city ... same price , but much better in every respect . \n",

However , did not live up to my expectation . The room ( ) wa tiny , with a tiny bathroom which actually ha no space to put the towel ( stored on a rack above the bathtub ) . If you want to take a shower you have to throw the towel onto the floor . The furniture had several cigarette hole , although it wa supposed to be a non-smoking room . The room are noisy due to the lack of any sound insulation . Breakfast is an extra 16 EUR per person which I thought wa included in the price , another bad surprise .

      " Review:  Highly Recommended We stayed at Hotel Caravaggio for two night in mid September , 2004 and , in fact , checked out just the member from NY who posted Sept. 28 . I knew then that he wa surprised and not pleased by the fact that his credit card charge reflected the USD rate a well a the Euro rate . I have a different perspective - the rate we were charged in Euro wa exactly a booked and of all the hotel we stayed in , the Caravaggio wa the only one whose credit card system did u the service of showing the exchange rate that would be posted to our and account . For the record , the exchange rate ( ) wa slightly better then the one I had been given a few day earlier at a US bank currency . It wa , in short , right in the accomodations , location , amenity ( including internet connection via laptop near the lobby ) , , and the gracious assistance offered by the staff , we can not say enough at . I would recommend to anyone and would definitely stay again . As we checked in we were also trying to get ticket to the ( soccer ) match and Carlo and assisted making phone call and finding where we could still get them and getting u there . , guy . Room wa good sized , quiet and comfortable with clean , modern bathroom . Best value of our entire trip . \n",

      " Review:  Ignore the negative review My husband and two child ( age 10 and 13 ) just returned from a five night stay at the hotel . Before I even booked this hotel , I did extensive research using this website and others to ensure we had a safe and enjoyable trip . After extensive research I finally decided on the Sunscape Grand and wa encouraged by all the positive feedback most people left on this site for folk to read . Yes , there were negative review , but the majority were good . Of course after I finally booked the trip ( through Vacations to Go -- highly recommend them ) , I began reading many more negative comment and wa worrying myself to death . to put all the negative review out of my mind and see for myself , since at this point the trip wa already booked . We hoped for the arrived at the hotel around 2:30 in the afternoon . Not only wa there NO wait for checking in , it wa done within 10 minute of getting there . We were greeted with a cold drink and received a small carrying case filled with lotion , shampoo , conditioner , etc . The bell cap took our luggage right away to our room . We were assigned a room in Building 5 which I had requested prior to arriving , a I had read that it wa one of the quietest in the evening . The request wa obviously met without my having to ask again upon checking . The room itself wa clean with no musty smell , no bug , no mold . It wa in need of updating , but for the money I paid , I knew I wa n't getting a first class Hilton or Marriott . No bug , clean sheet , clean towel , etc . wa fine with u . We did have no hot water two day around 6:30 pm but we assumed most of the hotel wa probably showering at the same time . Two of u had to wait 30 minute and the hot water wa back . Not a problem for u . We did have to ask for extra towel only one day and they were delivered within 15 minute . The pool water wa warm , but it wa over 90 degree every day and it sits mostly in the sun , is there anyone out there that ca n't figure out the water is going to heat up ? Hello ? The ocean water wa almost just a warm . It did have a lot of seaweed , which is n't my cup of tea , but it wa cleaned off the beach every day . I wa disturbed to find glass in the sand on the beach . Thought it wa a thing , but then kept finding piece . I finally asked one of the guy who had booked a snorkeling trip for my son and I and he said it wa because of folk bottle over the year ( not sure what is wrong with people , but nothing surprise me any more ) . There were many people who could n't even clean up their own cup and plate from around the pool . I assume they are the same people who would n't have a problem throwing bottle on the beach . In any event , the glass wa not isolated to just the Sunscape Grand a I walked the entire beach from the Sunscape to the end of the public beach and there were several other hotel who actually had set up on the beach for putting glass in . As for entertainment , you could be there all day and do nothing or you could keep busy every minute of every hour . There is a daily list of activity that varies from day to day . every night followed by a stage show . Twice a week the vendor come and set up and you can buy thing with them . Make sure you barter with them . They start high , but trust me , walk away and they 'll come down in price , considerably . The food wa fine . I would n't recommend the hamburger , they may be shaped like a hamburger , but they do n't look or taste like one . Did n't matter to u , we can eat a hamburger at home any time . All the other food wa good and plentiful . You could eat all day long if you wanted with a wide variety . Fresh fruit bar on the beach wa a nice added touch . As for drink , they too were plentiful . Our only complaint there wa the number of bartender the various location . Each had only one to a station and for the most part , this wa n't an issue or a problem . It wa annoying by 4:30 in the afternoon when everyone had had enough of the beach and decided to start at the same time . One bartender at the end of the pool where people could sit in the water , just wa n't cutting it . Those sitting in the seat felt they deserved a refill before folk standing in the back could even get their first . We just got out of the pool and went around to the other side where there wa another station available . Wo n't you with any more writing . If you are going to Punta Cana , I would recommend this hotel . For the money , you ca n't beat it . After walking the beach and seeing the other hotel along side it , they all looked the same and I 'm pretty sure , you will get the same type of food , service , room , and entertainment at any of them . I would also recommend checking Vacations to Go a they gave me a cheaper price than I got going directly to Sunscape 's web site by a few hundred dollar . \n",

The kiosk check-in is nice , the cafe is good , and the bar wa comfortable ( and serf a great ) . Oh yes , and the staff that I encountered were friendly and curteous . The location is good , we walked to Fenway Park for a game , and the facility are are above average . However , for the rate I paid ( convention rate of $ ) , the room itself should have been much nicer . My room had an amazing view of the Charles River but wa musty , carpet well worn beyond it year ( including large stain and burn from the iron ) , bathroom wa very dated and worn . The bed wa average at best . Furniture wa old and certainly not 4-star bottom line is : if you get a great Priceline deal or some other set-up for cheap , then this hotel will do . But this hotel is , priced , and sold a a 4-star property , it should do better to live up to expectation . \n",

      " Review:  Not a vacation hotel ... As a Marriott Rewards customer , I try to use Marriott hotel for most of my travel . Booking this Hotel ( and paying for it and not using reward ) wa a mistake . While the downtown location wa nice , the area is somewhat two block west there were many street people lying under the . One morning I went downstairs and there wa a person sleeping on the bench in front of the hotel ! I got twice while walking in the immediate neighborhood . The worst thing a far a I wa concerned wa the swimming pool . Located on the 7th floor ... NOT on the roof where the sun could reach it ... it wa between numerous high rise . This pool wa ... not refreshing cool , but ... and NO jacuzzi to at least sit in the sun . ( Due to the neighboring , the sun on the pool is available from perhaps 10:30 to 3:00 ... ) . The first night we arrived , I read the advertising brochure for the bar ... 2 for 1 drink and free snack ... when we went to the bar for this , the drink were VERY weak - I 'm convinced it wa le than a normal shot and the snack were chip and salsa . When I asked about the hot snack a advertised , the man in the bar/restaurant area said that they do n't have any demand for snack during the week and only serve them on Friday night ! The staff wa ok , not overly friendly - professional but cool . I will say that one person really stood out a a very helpful and caring person - Chef at the breakfast bar wa one person that should get praise ! Room cleaning wa done quickly and very well ... Parking wa $ 15 per day with in and out availability ... , a mistake for myself and family . Will not consider this hotel again and think that anyone who doe n't have business downtown should carefully consider their decision to book here ( This is not a hotel ! ) ... \n",

      " Review:  Great Hotel - Wonderful Views of the City I booked the Grand Marina from 3rd - 6th December for my fiance 's 30th Birthday weekend . This modern and beautifully decorated hotel is situated on the port . It is nice and quiet ( cruise ship horn ) and 5 minute walk from the bottom of the arriving I wa very slightly disappointed with the room , designated Superior in a 5 star hotel although it wa large and pleasant enough . I had specifically asked for a view and a wonderful view of the city it wa ( although in the photo of the hotel and with the benefit of a wide , the huge cable car station right in front of the hotel is ! ) . Try to stay 6th floor or above and either to the left or right of the front of the hotel . If you stay at the back you will look onto a pleasant courtyard and World Trade emailed the service before travelling to ask for a special touch for my fiance 's birthday and we received , on arrival , a bottle of ice cold cava and chocolate covered were great and service wonderful . You can even chose from 5 different type of pillow , all named after screen had never experienced a turn down service before and this wa amusing ! We would be relaxing or having a little siesta late afternoon and we would stand to one side a a a very nice lady our bed and put little mat next to our bed with our slipper ! Breakfasts were marvellous . The bar , with piano wa a good place to relax with a good Mary and nibble . Overall , a great place . In my opinion 4 1/2 star . \n",

      " Review:  Not a 5-star hotel , but not a bad hotel either I had never been to Spain before , and stayed at this hotel for a work conference . The taxi driver on the way over told me it wa one of the nicest hotel . I鈥檓 not so sure about that . The criterion for 鈥 ? ? in Europe must surely be very different from the US . I鈥檓 guessing the get extra star because of it size and ability to cater and hold large meeting ? Other than that , I can鈥檛 see what would make it 5-star . While there wa nothing wrong with the hotel , in my opinion it did not belong in the same family a your typical US 5-star establishment such a the Ritz or Four : while not 5-star in my opinion there wa nothing wrong with my room . Comfortable bed , spacious bathroom ( with separate vanity area from toilet , which is always nice if you鈥檙e not staying alone ) marble counter and plentiful toiletry . Rooms looked a little old , but all in all just fine , and cleaned thoroughly every day . Small , but no smaller than most european room . Concierge service wa hit or miss depending who you got at the desk . Cost of food in the hotel is outrageous ! Area : If you鈥檙e looking for a central location in Barcelona , this isn鈥檛 it . There is a tram outside the hotel , but I didn鈥檛 take it so not sure where it go ! There are a few little cafe next door to the hotel , and a giant dept . store a block down . Definitely venture out and buy your outside the hotel 鈥 ? the walk is worth the cost difference . There is a up the street from the hotel that is very interesting and pretty 鈥 ? definitely check it out if you have the time . Other than that , it didn鈥檛 seem like there wa a whole lot to do around the in all , the hotel wa fine , but if I wa travelling for pleasure I would not pick it . I stayed closer to the city center later in the trip after work , and would recommend finding a hotel closer to central Barcelona . \n",

      " Review:  Very Nice and Enjoyable - But Forget the restaurant 24/7 This is a very nice Hotel right in the heart of Waikiki , and one of the best i have ever stayed at and certainly one of the best in Waikiki , the room are unbelievably modern and look like they have been recently renovated with awesome Plasma TVs and those very comfortable Hilton Beds and pillow . The Pool on Level 10 is great , and we spent many an afternoon relaxing by the pool and sitting in the heated spa , there is a bar by the pool also , both pool and beach towel are provided free . On the same trip and prior to this Hotel we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort and Spa but split up our accommodation so we could be closer to Waikiki Beach and this hotel wa perfect , with just a 2 min walk you are right on the beach.The only negative I have about the Hotel is the restaurant called 24/7 which is located on the premise , if you want good food and service totally forget it and go to another restaurant on the main drag , we had the worst service experience we have ever had in this restaurant . Would you wait 45 min to be served by a waiter who constantly ignored you ? , and then when your food wa ready you watch it be left on the bar to go cold and be picked at and played with by the child off another table . , only to be delivered to your table with a here you go sorry about the wait . When we complained and said we wanted another meal the , waiter wanted nothing more to do with u , and we had to complain to the chef behind the bar who had to quickly make another meal , and the waiter a having trouble with the large area he had to wait on , this wa total we watched him chat with Asian guest for 20 min when he could have been serving our food . Yes we will remember the having worst waiter we have ever come across . No apology from the Manager can not believe that a Hilton Hotel would have such a terrible restaurant associated with it . Excellent alternative to this restaurant are Dukes at the Outrigger Waikiki Hotel , beautiful and right on the beach , The Cafe , The an Buffet . But what Ever you do do n't eat at the at the Hilton Prince Kuhio , or if you do set your watch , and keep an eye on your food , they may serve up something that is stone cold and ha been by a bunch of in all a great Hotel - But terrible restaurant . \n",

      " Review:  Super value This really is a good hotel . It look quite expensive , but first Amsterdam hotel are expensive generally and second it 's worth every cent . Just a the other reviewer , I wa amazed at how friendly the staff were , it feel like a real family hotel . And we got free coffee on arrival , too.The room is spacious , quiet in spite of the tram outside and clean . It 's nice that the minibar is just a fridge for stuff you buy yourself ( and of course you 're told where to buy stuff the minute you just think of it ) and not a load of overpriced drink you do n't 's not smack in the centre , but that 's probably a good thing . The Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are just ten minute ' walk away , and Leidseplein ( for the nightlife and restaurant ) only twenty , and of course you can take the tram . The neighbourhood is nice and quiet , with more than a few cafe and a convenience store : look for the near the entrance to the underground parking on van near the Van Gogh Museum . For shopper , PC is just ten minute ' walk tip : if this is your first time in Amsterdam , your best bet from Schiphol is the airport shuttle : look for the green shuttle and ask the driver where to buy ticket . If you feel comfortable with Amsterdam 's public transport , it is faster ( and much cheaper ) to take the train to ( there are load ) and then tram 5 to , rather than going all the way to the Central Station . \n",

      " Review:  Friendly staff , Get what you pay for The hotel staff wa friendly and quick . This is a no frill hotel which may be the reason why they are so reasonably priced . Upon check in , the clerk wa very efficient and just handed me the room key and told me the room number . There wa no key packet with the room number on it . Once we got in the room , it wa small to american standard . While the review stated it would be small , I wa still quite surprised . It wa reasonably clean but a little run down . The bathroom wall wa peeling , there wa a little mildew in the tile crack in the shower . The wall are thin but that did n't bother u much . It wa raining during our trip so there wa a bit of a leak from the 2nd floor ( 3rd floor in the US ) to the 1st floor outside of some poor lady hotel room . To be completely neutral , it wa great . But for me personally , I will be upgrading to a hotel with more star . \n",

I arrived on a night and wa greeted by the friendly reception staff who were very pleasant . I had phoned the previous night and asked for a quiet room if possible . They had remembered this and gave me a room on the 26th floor , which wa great a it wa really quiet . The room itself wa a size very similar to that of the where i stayed previously . A clean room with all the necessary requirement that a business traveller would need . Part of my package included breakfast at the hotel .

The decor wa fine , though nothing upscale . They brought u a free refrigerator and microwave to , there is no view from the room ( we overlooked the busy parking lot ) . The small water park is crowded . We could n't find chair . It is littered and look very used by the end of the day . The kid did enjoy the water park though . The restaurant we tried wa not very good . Walking across the street to get at 's restaurant wa much better . On arrival , after flying all day , we wanted to check in an hour or so early . But no room were available , so we sat in the lobby and waited until the exact check-in would stay here again if we were using it a a base for touring . But to stay at a resort and relax , this would definitely not be the place . \n",

      " Review:  Believe every word you read ! We have just returned to the UK from our 4 night trip to NYC and this wa our chosen hotel . ( a full trip report will appear later when i have caught up ) . From the moment our taxi pulled up outside the hotel and we were met by a smiling Chris on the door , to the early morning call on the last day to tell u our ride to JFK wa waiting outside , we have nothing but praise . We booked a junior suite and were on the corner of the 26th floor with a view from one side up Manhattan towards the Chrysler and on the other towards the East River . We were visiting for my wife birthday and i had mentioned that when booking last November - and on arrival there wa a card , complimentary wine and fruit . The room wa huge and the bed lovely and comfortable - in the morning we raised the curtain , up the pillow and with that first cup of coffee , watched the sun rise over the East River skyline . Admittedly the bathroom wa a little but more than adequate . As for location - a everyone else ha said you are on street but we found it to be the ideal place . It wa fairly quiet ( a much a NYC can be ) 5 min from , 5-10 from and the Chrysler , 10 min from Macys and 15-20 from Times Square . There are load of place to eat and drink within a 10 minute walk ( is just around the corner on 3rd and Steakhouse a light stroll away ) . You also have the 24 hour a couple of door away or a Starbucks within 3-4 min . All in all a great place to stay and we will definately return . \n",

The staff were always friendly and helpful especially and on the front hotel is in the financial district which can be quiet over the weekend but the easy access to the cable car and easy walking to Chinatown or Fishermans wharf outweigh is a daily maid and turn down service and the only reason we have marked down wa because they wa no butter when we ordered room service for breakfast one day . Plus the hotel will only change $ 100 traveller 's cheque per day . We were not impressed by the service offered by United Airlines . The flight attendant seemed more on making sure they got their sleep and disappeared for large of the you are no longer allowed to take on flight the amount of drink offered wa poor . I would have quite happily paid for a tea or coffee or even a water . I really got the impression that we were not going to be allowed to forget we were travelling economy class . I do n't think we will be flying with them anymore and have our air mile to the American Red Cross . \n",

They couldn鈥檛 do enough for room wa on the 6th floor and it wa spotlessly clean and my wife is fussy ! The bed linen and towel were changed every day ; in fact one morning we left the not ? sign on the door by mistake , but on returning to our room we had been left a message on the telephone answering machine by the housekeeper to say to call her if we needed our room cleaning or fresh linen to be brought to u . Where would you get that kind of service in England ? Although the breakfast wa ? we found it to be really good with plenty of choice to suit everyone . Again everything wa spotlessly clean in the dining room with the food freshly prepared each morning . The complimentary tea and coffee that wa available throughout the day wa very welcome after a hard day sightseeing . It wa lovely to return to such a nice hotel at the end of the day , knowing that you would feel relaxed and comfortable in your hotel room.We can only recommend this hotel to others a we are sure you won鈥檛 be disappointed . I suspect there are 4 or 5 star hotel that couldn鈥檛 offer the standard of cleanliness and excellent customer service that we received here . We will definitely be coming back . \n",

      " Review:  Good time , but average resort We 've been to other carribean place , but this wa our ( my husband and myself ) first time to Punta Cana . We booked our trip through Apple Vacations . Overall , we had a good vacation , but would probably not return to the - The flight wa fine ( but the snack for purchase wa horrible ) . Shuttle the airport wa prompt with no ( ) - we found the resort to be nice , clean , and friendly . People were constantly cleaning up and for the most part and the staff wa friendly ( in spite of the language barrier ) . Except for the front desk , most of the staff do not speak English so if you speak Spanish , Italian , or French , it can go a long way . My high school Spanish wa really out of date but I managed to say a few word here and there in Spanish and wa able communicate with the staff . The resort caters to a lot Europeans so everything is in Euros , etc . There is a whole section of the resort that is dedicated to Italians . The week we were there , lot of group with young Italians . This is what we found frustrating at time : for the most part , we did not find the Italian guest to be friendly or even considerate of others . They smoke everywhere , even if you 've been sitting at the couch before them they came along . They cut in front of you at the bar without regard to you being there and politely waiting your turn . Fort the most part , we shrugged it off a difference in culture and tried to have a good time . Ocean Bavaro wa clean and nice . We stayed in block 5 ( had a good view of the beach from our balcony ) . We thought the room wa clean and properly furnished . We paid tip everyday for maid service and they gave good service . We did not find the room to be musty or smelly . Overall , no complaint on the - Buffet wa okay , A La Carte Restaurants were better . We enjoyed Spanish and Italian restaurant the most . If you are a meat lover , Brazilian restaurant is a good place to eat . Japanese restaurant wa too salty for my taste bud ( and very not Japanese ) - wa wonderful , clear warm water . There are some seaweed but nothing to really bother - the light show wa nice . the people seem to put alot of effort into the show and it wa nice but most of it came across a an talent - We stayed a week in the middle of June . Some shower but they were . The water wa always warm ! For English speaker ( especially Americans ) , I would recommend a different resort . \n",

      " Review:  Always ! I have stayed at The Outrigger Reef the past 4 time I 've been to Hawaii and it 's always been great . The hotel is a little older but it 's in a super location , on the Waikiki but at the very end and up one block so you do n't have all the noise and foot traffic . They are in the process of building the Trump Tower which is literally a stone 's throw away so if you do n't like construction noise , do n't stay the event that one doe there is quite a bit to do . Hilton Hawaiian Village is a short walk where they have great shopping and restaurant . Most of the designer store ( , , ) are up a couple of block from the hotel . They have 2 restaurant , The Shore is an open air place for those that want a quick breakfast or lunch and The Ocean Restaurant for a nicer touch - both are right on the beach and have amazing view of the sunset and Diamond Head . The beach is good , nice and clean . Staff are great ! They have a little cabana they hang out in all day and come by every now and then to you when it get hot . They also are helpful in answering any question you have . and umbrella are available for $ 15 per day . You are free to leave , have lunch and still have your chair waiting for you ! The hotel ha two - one in the lobby near the pool and one in the Shore . Lobby bar is nice if you like a le crowded scene , Shore Bar get really packed most night but is really fun . They also feature live sure you step out to the beach at dusk for the Hilton Hawaiian Village firework on Friday night ! It 's kind of a fun treat . They also show first run movie on the opposite end of the beach ( across the street from the zoo ) on Friday night complete with huge screen and are a little dated but CLEAN . Bathrooms can be small but hopefully most of your stay is n't in the room ! Service is great and timely . Staff always willing to get extra towel or wait to clean your room if need be . This hotel is also pretty reasonably priced , especially for the location . So I reccomend waiting for Trump to finish then take a trip to Outrigger Reef ! \n",

We were on our honeymoon and it wa so relaxing and exactly what we needed . The transportation to the hotel wa via bus ( through Tours ) , and took about 45 minute . We had the opportunity to see some of the other resort , and the ride wa pleasant . Once we arrived at the Riu ( by the way , the lobby is so gorgeous ) , our luggage wa taken , and we were checked in and welcomed with a nice drink . The front desk gave u our towel card and key , and gave u a general overview of the hotel . Everyone wa very friendly and there wa no language barrier . Our room wa a king suite and wa very clean , and comfortable . It wa on the second floor , close to the restaurant , and our balcony looked out into the courtyard . The bar and fridge were fully stocked and always remained that way . Whenever we were in the room when they came to it , the guy gave u a little gift which I thought wa very sweet . The staff wa always very friendly saying hello , and smiling . We spent most of our time at the beach and the pool . The beach wa so clear blue water ( so salty though , I wa surprised ) and the sand wa so soft ! The pool were great . We spent most of our time at the pool bar . Ask for when you go . He wa great , and kept making u special drink to try . They did the trick ! ) We had a lot of fun hanging out there.The food wa very good and better than we had expected . We tried the Italian , the , and the Gourmet restaurant . All were tasty but we liked the the best by far . The rest of the time we stuck to the two buffet , and were able to find different item to eat with no problem . We were ready for some good American fast food by the end of the week , do n't get me wrong , but the food wa delicious for the most part and there wa a great variety to choose only extra we tried were parasailing which wa a blast and so worth it , and the massage which is always a nice treat . We did a little shopping too , but most of the gift item are what you would usually find on vacation . We tried to get cigar and Mamajuana for most people since it wa something a little different . So , I guess that 's it . I would definitely recommend this resort to everyone . It 's very relaxing and will definitely help you unwind . Beautiful check it out ! ! ! \n",

      " Review:  in the Bali National Park Right up in the North West corner of Bali , it 's over 4 hour drive from . After check in there is a 20 minute boat ride to the resort itself , no road go there only the track used by the park . The accommodation is in 10 individual lanai , equipped with everything you would expect in a good hotel . As you are in the Park there is wildlife everywhere from insect and frog up to , wild pig and monkey so you are recommended to keep the door shut . However , where else can you have breakfast and watch long monkey watching you from the tree 20 foot away or have a dinner by the beach while wild pig charge about nearby . from the is spectacular and there is a dive unique resort well away from everything , but if you have to keep in touch , they have a WiFi link \n",

The room is a little bit expensive but nice ( stayed at 5th floor , nice view of the city ) furniture , look cozy . I 'm an European so I would 've the new floor ( 3rd I think ) which is newly refurbished but . Keep that in mind when nice breakfast , polite staff , free Internet . Had problem with Internet in one of the room ( we had two ) , staff wa did n't to fix it before we figure it out to use the other room 's ... is good , only 10-15 min from the and it 's not a crowded area . The only disadvantage is the railway that affect your walk a little bit . Area is clean for a railway station ( compared to Paris for example ) ... \n",

      " Review:  Wedding trip I will start by saying that this review may be a bit from what many people may experience at this hotel , a we were down there with of 30 for our wedding . That being said , we had an AMAZING time . The only negative i could possibly say is that the resort is huge . Once you take a bit to figure out how it work this turn into a , a the ground are breathtaking . We recieved impeccable service . Our checkin wa about 20 min , then we started walking to our room and were picked up right away by a guy in golf cart . We were not in royal service . We were taken to a beautiful honeymoon suite beside the caribe pool and the beach . Some of our guest who came on the flight had quite a long wait to check in , but many welcome cocktail were brought out by lovely waitress . As a wedding , the wedding coordinator organized reservation for our group for the whole week , so we did not have that inconvenience of trying to get reservation , a I have heard this can be difficult . We at at the japanese ( 2x ) , French , mexican , American , and Le gourmet . All were just fantastic . The food wa excellent and teh attention to detail wa superb . Your wine glass never hit empty a people are constantly filling it up . That is one thing that I wa extremely impressed service . march break being so busy , I thought it would n't be great . These people work so hard at pleasing you . In the morning there are hundred of people cleaning all over the resort , and continues throughout the day . Never had to search for a lounger , no matter what time it wa always available . Wedding : Ladies , this is the place to do it . The best way to describe it are : , elegant , and a my guest put it , romantic . The wedding coordinator is so organized and professional , and there were so many detail attended to . They are not great at keeping up with email , but after initially booking , you can rely on them to do their job . You really do n't need to do anything before you go . So stress free , fun and you really get to focus on the actual getting married and not all the fussy detail u bride about . If you are considering the melia for your wedding DO IT ! ! ! \n",

The hallway carpet were dirty , but the suite itself wa fine , although . As other reviewer have noted , the monorail run right in front of the hotel , at the level of the second floor . We could barely hear it from our floor , so it wasn鈥檛 an issue for u , but I can imagine that it would be more of a nuisance lower down . The minibar fridge wa turned off , so it and the drink in it were warm , and the ice cube tray contained warm water .

      " Review:  Better hotel choice in New Orleans , no doubt ... . February 19 , husband and I just returned from a trip to New Orleans . After hour of researching hotel and reading numerous review , we booked a room directly with Le Richelieu . This wa a very special trip for me a I wa celebrating my birthday . I requested a room with a balcony . What we got wa room # that had a view of a roof ! It wa located directly above the kitchen . When we opened the window for fresh air ( the room wa quite stuffy and warm ) we could hear the kitchen staff talking and laughing . To make matter worse the window would not fully close , there wa a large gap between the two side . The air conditioner , even on high , put out very little cool air . The towel and sheet were rough and threadbare . The television set seemed to be from the and wa sitting on top of a hotel is not remotely close to much of what you go to New Orleans to see . The best thing I can mention about this hotel is a young man named who worked at the reception desk . He wa most helpful and husband and I travel extensively and try to be careful about our choice of lodging . This wa our fourth trip to New Orleans , and there will be more in the future . We will not be staying at this hotel again , nor would we recommend it to others . \n",

      " Review:  Nikko - Great Location This hotel ha a lot going for it . The location is outstanding . It 's located in the Polanco neighborhood which is full of high end dealer , large Spanish home , upscale shopping and many restaurant . It 's near the W hotel a well a the JW Marriott . Honestly , if I were staying on my own I 'd probably pick one of the these hotel just because they seemed a bit more modern . The Nikko is huge and there are several restaurant and bar within the hotel . There is even an English Pub that serf sushi and taco . ( It 's an English Pub in a Japanese hotel in Mexico City - It 's very international ! ) The hotel is very clean and my room , which wa a standard king , wa spacious and well appointed and spotless . It wa not brand new or incredibly modern , but it had been remodeled in the last 3-5 year . ( I believe the deluxe room have been remodeled this year ) . Overall the hotel 's public space have an 80 's or 90 's vibe to them . Nothing is worn out or old , it 's just a bit dated . The staff wa helpful when needed and the breakfast buffet wa excellent . I wa staying a a solo woman traveling with a business group and felt 100 % safe the entire week . I did not use the indoor pool or exercise facility , but stopped in for a peek and they seemed very nice . There are also several shop within the hotel and an American Express office a well . I would stay at the Nikko again and I would be comfortable recommending it to friend . However if the price is the same I 'd rather stay at more modern hotel like the W. But if the price were le , I 'd stay at the Nikko again and be perfectly happy . \n",

We went for a conference and after reading a few negative review had considered staying elsewhere , however we are extremely glad we decided to it the conference hotel . The hotel wa great , and the staff wa extremely helpful and pleasant . We asked for a room with a view , high floor , and near the elevator ( based on other review ) . The pleasant reception desk person told u that view room were not near the elevator , so we opted to go for the view . We had a 15th floor room with an outstanding view of the Bay and Bay building . It might have been better , but we 're not sure others have mentioned , the location really make this a top choice . We had purchased the City Pass on line which gave free access to all Muni a well a a number of museum ( very worthwhile ) . We also purchased on line to get u to the hotel . The Bart station is right outside the door of the hotel . Also , the famous cable car , restored trolley on the F line ( access to the a well a all the way up Market to the ) , Muni underground , and all kind of bus line are literally right outside the door ! The location can not be a great meal wa had at at the Church St. station on both the trolley and the across the street is the Ferry Building with all kind of shop and restaurant . We particularly enjoyed the Island ( the owner wa on line in front of u and refused to rank ' ; he even allowed u to take a better located table ! ) . Also , is not to be not be afraid of this hotel -- it will serve you well ( OK , the pillow a little flat . ) . \n",

We booked a two bedroom and it wa a very comfortable and nice room . The room wa large and had a full kitchen , laundry room , dining room and living area .

Having stayed at other Ritz Carlton property , I found that this hotel could not compare . Upon check-in , we were not offered the option of having our bag brought to our room . I asked if they had the newspaper that I prefer , and they did not . To their credit , they found one ( slightly from having been read before ) and promised to have one delivered to my room the next morning . This did not happen though . Since our visit wa in warmer weather , we did enjoy the location and spend a good deal of time walking Battery Park . We were also able to explore Wall Street , Chinatown , Little Italy , and Village without using a taxi . This could not have been in the cooler weather , though . On the last day of our stay , we checked out and asked that our car be brought to the front . The front desk told u it would be about 20 minute . Unfortunately , it took nearly an hour for our car to appear . Although this inconvenience were minor , they did leave u with the feeling that we would stay elsewhere next time . \n",

We would n't hesitate to stay here flew in and took a cab ( $ ) from the airport - found that a car is a handicap if you stay in town . From this location you can walk to many place or take a streetcar or other public transportation , and in the French Quarter , you 're better off to walk to avoid being stuck in traffic ( waiting for pedestrian to move out of the way or the narrow , sometimes closed street ) . Parking cost are high everywhere . We loved the location - far enough away from Bourbon St. to find some peace but close enough when you 're in the mood to enjoy it . The River Walk , Harrah 's Casino and other sight are also a short walk upgraded to the Club Intercontinental for $ - buy exclusive access to the 14th floor ( we do n't have kid ) , a very nice continental breakfast served every morning on the same floor and a top-notch happy hour service - glad we made that decision . Our hostess wa very friendly and bed in our room wa very comfortable , our room wa attractive , quiet and clean , and the shower and TV worked fine . \n",

However , you cant go wrong with an AI in the Caribbean 鈥 ? we had a good time . I speak fluent Spanish which help . I think for speaker they may have a better time in an in an English speaking country like Jamaica , , etc . Not that many Americans at this resort , lot of Italians , , from Miami and Latin Americans . The food wa very varied , lot of choice of restaurant - I just didn鈥檛 like most of it - but I could always find something - so lot of steak and lobster for me . I don鈥檛 know why people recommend the Saona Island tour so much - I thought it wa a rip-off . Long bus trip , then long boat trip to then just go to a beach on the island that is not that Highly recommend the Park tour . That wa the best of the entire trip . You go horse back riding , you go to a farm . You cross a bridge over a river , You swim in a river and swing like from a rope . You visit the country side and the mountain . Then they take you to a very gorgeous , beautiful beach ( in Macao ) . , our guide wa great . You learn alot about the country , etc . Free open bar the whole trip . This tour is awesome . Lots of the little train shuttle to the Golf resort and play the free mini golf in the early evening . The people are all very nice 鈥 ? lot of smile . \n",

      " Review:  Absolutely the best ! ! Absolutely the BEST resort we 've ever stayed at . The staff wa very helpful from the second we got off the shuttle to the moment we got back on to leave . Everyone knew sufficient English to effectively help their food wa out of this world . We ate at the buffet in the main lobby almost every night , with the exception of eating at El Gaucho one night and the Italian restaurant another . Booking wa very easy . We did n't get sick once on the entire trip even though we ate everything in sight . My personal experience is that people who have everything to complain about will generally throw in some sickness with the vacation a I have never heard anyone who had a positive experience get room wa amazing . Large bed , cute sitting area , large door that were nice to open up and let the tropical breeze blow through the room . The room are all surrounded by gorgeous tropical vegetation which provides an extremely calming experience . Our room happened to be the furthest from the beach and it absolutely did not take , a previously mentioned , 10-15 minute to get to the beach . We walked there in about 5 minute flat each day , even le time if we did take the shuttle . We personally enjoyed walking a the resort offered so much to see that you could really take it all in with a nice walk . We came across a mini nature reserve of sort in the middle of the resort one day which turned out to be a great beach wa pristine . Not too crowded and nice and quiet . We did n't have to deal with obnoxious drunken or screaming child . Enough chair down by the beach for casino wa a great time and not overcrowded at all ! ! People always available to bring you , I would rate this resort 6 out of 5 star - our experience wa THAT great . I would recommend this resort to anyone ! ! \n",

      " Review:  Great Location , Great Service ! We had a great stay at the Hotel Alessandra . The room wa clean and quiet , the location could n't have been better , and the staff wa helpful and patient . Upon check in , they upgraded our room , which wa a nice surprise . They also directed u to fabulous cafe and eatery , one of which we had the best wild mushroom at that I think I might dream about for the rest of my life ! One of the staff member also gave u a tip that the museum were open late on the night of our stay , so we went around 8pm and had them practically to ourselves . It wa such a treat ! The only drawback I would mention is that they have a , so if staying out all night is important , you should be aware of this in advance . \n",

      " Review:  If it were a Holiday Inn , it would be average Stayed here on a last minute trip to Amsterdam . Expected this to be like other Crowne Plaza 's I have stayed at ( Chicago and , Miami South Beach Royal , New Orleans , New York Times Square ) . Should have listened to the review on this site ! ! ! Because I am a Priority Club club member , I wa upgraded to a Club Room . Used priority club point for a 4 night stay . Unbelievable . Furniture wa falling apart ( chair leg fell off ) , shower tile need repair , toilet paper not replenished for 2 day and minibar not restocked for 3 day . Elevator requires keycard and worked 50 % of the time . Some front desk staff were very helpful , others were and unhelpful . on bed not changed unless I specifically found the maid and asked . Club lounge printer out and attendant did not know what to do . Air conditioning barely worked and , because window did n't open , got very warm and unpleasant for sleeping . Worst wa on check out . in lobby stated that upgrade to club room meant free wireless internet and free minibar . On checkout -- not before -- I wa informed that these club room amenity did not apply to me , so I ended up paying over $ 100 for internet and minibar , which I had not wrote an email letter to the hotel and priority club . They 've apologized and offered to my priority club point . At least that wa a decent thing to do . Would not stay here again if I wa looking for a 4 or 5 star hotel . I would stay if I wa looking for a 2 or 3 star . \n",

We have been at the hotel for two night and are quite pleased . The maid , Florida from the , leaf the room fresh and clean every morning and provides u with regular and coffee for our morning . She is a delightful and sweet little lady and very accommodating . You will also have access to the internet . If you don鈥檛 use the computer , there is always a morning paper outside your door when you awake .

      " Review:  Perfect Vacation ! My family stayed at the Ocean Blue this past August . I ca n't say enough great thing about the resort . Overall , we had a perfect stay . The staff could n't have been friendlier . You could sense they were trying so hard to please . I recommend the Elite Club for those who want a little more luxury ( upgraded room , free internet , proximity to beach , etc . ) We had no water problem ( the shower in the Elite bath wa small in comparison to the huge tub ! ) , no bug , the food wa very good ( El wa great ! ) , the red wine we had wa decent , the weather wa terrific ( with the exception of the day passed by ) , the beach wa beautiful . There wa a lot of seaweed ( more so than when I wa there in February ) , but I attribute this to the season and the storm up the ocean . The hotel feedback from the guest , to be even better . Just go and relax . Enjoy what the resort ha to offer . I cried when we had to leave . \n",

      " Review:  and reasonably priced I found the staff exceptionally polite and helpful . Check-in , even 3 hour early , wa a breeze ( , the check-out button on the room phone wa n't working , but it wa a minor annoyance ) . While I did n't much care for the scheme in the room or corridor , everything wa comfortable , immaculately maintained , and professionally managed . There seem to be lot of meeting and conference here . While I can see how this might property resource a other review have mentioned , during my stay , everything wa well run . A few minor quibble : a others have mentioned , there is a high level of noise .. bring earplug . The elevator can be slow and quite crowded during peak hour . While the property is technically central , it 's far enough away from Union St that some traveler ( elderly , or with small child ) might find the walk more than they for . Others will have no problem , and SFO is nothing if not a walking city . Overall , a reliable choice for the leisure or business traveler , especially when discount rate are available through one of the online service ( $ is a bargain for San Francisco hotel ) . \n",

      " Review:  Fabulous We ( my husband and I and another couple ) stayed here one night after our cruise and we all absolutely loved this hotel . I wa nervous because I wa the one that made the reservation and you know how that can sometimes go ! But from the moment we checked in to the moment we left we enjoyed our stay tremendously . When we arrived we were immediately greeted a we got out of the taxi and our bag were taken care of . Check-in wa a breeze ... although that could have something to do with the fact that there happened to be no one else in line when we arrived ! We arrived early and our room wa n't ready which we did n't expect it to be . We were offered a hospitality room ( which wa one of the hotel room ) to use to up , etc . So we put our suit on and headed right out to the beach for the afternoon . The staff were all friendly . I wa pleasantly surprised when we checked out the next morning that the gentleman behind the desk actually remembered my name and greeted me by name . The hotel room itself wa great . I did n't find it small at all ( could that be because we just came off of a week on a cruise ship ? ? ? ) . There wa a vanity right outside the bathroom which wa perfect for hair and makeup and best of all - the lighting wa good for doing your makeup ! ( can to this issue ! ) .We did n't eat in the hotel so I ca n't comment on that . We did have breakfast in a small diner located in the strip mall across the street - food wa good ( typical breakfast stuff ) and very reasonably priced . The hotel is about a 5 minute ride to the airport and I wa surprised that the whole afternoon we spent on the beach ( and the next morning ) we never heard any plane go in all I highly recommend this hotel and if we go back we 'll definitely stay here again . \n",

      " Review:  Much improved since opening Spent a few night here in October 2007 and wa very pleasantly surprised at the progress that 's been made since they first opened in 2005 . Although this wa my first stay here , I had a group of colleague stay there for 2 month in 2005 just after the hotel had opened ( I wa living in Paris at the time ) and found the service and general of staff to be consistently indifferent and , and sometimes chaotic . Given the memory of this , I had been a little reluctant to book a stay on a 3-day stay , this appears now to have greatly changed . Staff were friendly and very accommodating ( especially by Paris standard ) , both at reception and in the bar/restaurant food is traditional French fare , and very , very good , if somewhat costly , although the staff seemed unable to advise on the wine list ( may have just been that particular night ) .The surrounding area is of little interest to tourist , being on the edge of Paris proper ( ' ) but transport into the centre is quick and easy by metro . \n",

      " Review:  Old yet familiar This wa a wonderful choice it wa very and the access to the area is just great . Being on top of one of the hill in San Francisco give you a great view from Bush St down to the Financial District . Plus it is a short walk to Grant which is where China Town is . The proximity to Tenderloin wa a concern until I realized that it wa far enough up that the element would n't go so far a to get this location . The Staff is wonderful they let me in every night since I stayed out and they were very helpful . I wa able to even check in at 12 . There is art in all the hallway in this beautifully decorated hotel . The street noise can be a bit much . I did speak the manager about this and she said that the city would not let her change them to double window because it wa historic . After all that walking getting to sleep is n't much of a problem . \n",

Nice room excellent service , fantastic food . We ate at the buffet every day , breakfast and dinner . were great . themed dinner ( mexican , Dominican , BBQ , ) the seafood is awesome shrimp lobster oh my god it wa awesome . We ate everything and no one got ill . However , eating fresh fruit and salad , and spicy food are part of our daily diet . , ask the bartender to make you thier special drink . I highly recommend the el at the pool bar . Go prepared ... take plenty of sunscreen ( pack twice what you think you 'll need , the water and sun will require frequent ) you can pay more than $ USD for a new isolated mug , you will be happy for a cool drink while on your a raft type item for in the beach flea market wa not for u , aggressive vendor , however it is a nice walk up the beach . \n",

Each and every employee I came in contact with at the Windsor Court wa friendly and professional . The facility are wonderful and are showing no ill effect from Katrina . I had a suite reserved until my family had to back out at the last minute so I to a deluxe room . The room wa exceptionally large and very comfortable . The restroom wa very large and marble tiled . The bed wa outstanding a were the pillow . It would be nice for a 5* hotel to use fitted sheet on the bottom a the flat sheet refused to stay tucked in . Also , I 'm not sure if the people in the room above me were loud walker or there is not much sound insulation between floor . Those problem were minimal compared to the overall exceptional experience I had with the Windsor Court . As mentioned in several other review the location is outstanding , close to the Riverwalk , the Aquarium , Harrah 's , the French Quarter , The Super , and the Conference Center . I would highly recommend a stay in the Windsor Court . \n",

I am definitely returning in the winter . The beach wa wonderful . The sand is white , the sky wa blue and you can walk for more than an hour and not even cover half of the beach stretch . We also enjoyed the pool which is very nicely located in front of the beach with a wet bar and hot tub . We had dinner outside by the pool and beach and on the restaurant terrace . The food wa great . In the evening the music in the lobby bar wa very nice . On a couple of evening we ventured out of the resort and found very nice local spot to dine and enjoy . Everything from a and restaurant to a ( name which they use to reference a local joint ) .The resort wa price and I definitely think we got more than our worth .

The pool , , through the resort which allows you to go wherever you want whether it be enjoying the pool game or quietly relaxing with a good by the way , my enthusiasm got ahead of me , our trip wa only 1 week Mar 1st , which we will remedy next year . The food wa excellent , you could have a breakfast buffet style or if you are a late riser at the lobster house , lunch at the buffet or at the Grill , by the way a hotdog at the Grill is a sausage not a , , ( Steak ) , take your pick we only sampled 4 of them , thats why i recommend 2 week , and found those we tried are on par with any restraunt that we have gone to and surpassed many of you find yourself enjoying the beach or pool too much at lunch to go and eat there are sandwich ( or meat filling ) or freshly made Pizza 's being carried around for your , both are good , i personally ate way too much pizza one day and could not eat supper . The nightly entertainment wa really good , a different show every night at from a Michael Jackson to Circus to Magic to a International night , which were by a Ice , ( different ) Martini making , or to the above every night there wa Domingo , a superb player , i bought 2 CD 's , he played from till and from on outside . We will now discus the one of the most important issue , the people , THEY ARE THE MOST we have met in all our travel , i think they actually take pleasure in being are a few name to remember , from the Martini Bar always smiling and there when you need a refill , , Benjamin and Juan from if it and raining ( we did have a little ) they will make you forget it they are great , the trainer , we do not play , wa great he showed u around the sport area and and but not least be careful of him he is friendly outgoing and getting you in employee named above , are not the only one we would want to thank for a vacation but are the only one that to mind at the time of writing this review . In conclusion i can only say we , my wife and i , are planning to go back next year for 2 week . \n",

The location wa excellent , the room wa modern and clean , the bed wa good , and the reception staff friendly and helpful ( except for one female staff member ) . But there were several serious problem . First , the water wa , full of . When we mentioned this , we were told that everyone in Barcelona drink bottled water because it always taste like . We had to drag 1 1/2 bottle of water from a market several block away . For the equivalent of 25 cent a bottle , a hotel of this caliber should provide it to guest . Second , the two English language TV channel both had terrible reception all during our five night stay . We were told that it wa the fault of the satellite company , but when we moved to a hotel near the airport for the next two night , the reception wa just fine . Third , the Metro noise wa very noticeable on the sixth floor . For a hotel costing about $ a night including two breakfast , plus over $ 26 a night for parking , these condition are unacceptable . \n",

The accessible bedroom wa on the 7th floor and we were pleased to see how much space there wa .

During the day , the beach is quiet , and you can walk from one end to the other , about half an hour , and only pas several people . In the evening , the beach come alive with local kid playing soccer game and amazing small fish restaurant . The restaurant are more like hut with dozen of table situated on the sandy beach . Go to the hut , pick a fish or lobster , and sit back down only to have a delicious BBQ meal delivered to you 10 minute later . Enough about the beach . The ground of the IC are immaculately maintained . People , picking up freshly fallen leaf , and sand . The service is extremely good and personalized . It will shock you at first in that staff will constantly ask how you are by name , did you like the chicken you had for dinner last night , or how wa your day in Ubud ? How do these folk even know whom I am ? ? ? We spent several day at the Oberoi on , and while it 's very beautiful , the value at the IC is far better overall when you consider cost . Highly recommend the IC ! \n",

The hotel is beautiful and offer the perfect balance of grandeur and treating everyone like an honored guest . My family , including 2 kid ( 11 and 13 ) arrived in New Orleans early Saturday , March 25 , and went directly to a neighborhood effort .

We have stayed at several other resort in the Dom Rep over the last few year and we all agree Majestic wa the best . We previously stayed at the Iberostar and Gran Bahia resort -- we enjoyed our vacation every time , but this resort earned a few extra point for friendliness of staff , food and the : wind through the resort like a river ; wide in some area and narrow in others . The depth never . Water is clean and refreshing . We have played the towel game at every other resort we 've stayed at and found it simply wa n't necessary here . There are always plenty of lounge chair in every area of the pool and along the : clean , soft and HOT ! Tried boogie boarding -- we looked ridiculous , but had a lot of laugh . Try the water sport if you 're up for it ... Food : plentiful . Surprisingly good beef at the restaurant . choice at the buffet . The lobster wa undercooked at the seafood restaurant , but ask for it to be grilled some more and problem solved . Keep a eye on the of your , do n't : Coco Loco , Dirty Monkey , Pina Colada , The Majestic ... all wonderful . and available for vodka drink . Try the Majestic -- we received one upon arrival and continued ordering them all week . Mamajuana is the local drink -- it take some getting used to ( local and spice soaked in rum ) , but the effect is somewhere between and too many . Got the during more than one mamajuana : we loved that you only needed to make reservation at the Gourmet and show restaurant ... other resort you need reservation for every meal that 's not at a buffet . Food and service wa fine . The Japanese show restaurant wa not authentic Japanese , it wa basically a stir fry . That wa fine though , the majority of u are n't into sushi and other of the Japanese diet , but thought we 'd enjoy the show . Try the pasta bar at the restaurant and buffet ... yummy . They make your pasta dish to order with several pasta and sauce to choose from . Rooms : well appointed , sunny color , feel . Bed wa firm which my husband and I loved . each night . Okay , the cocktail and full meal every day may have for some of that restful sleep . No charge for the room safe , plenty of space for clothing . Some folk seemed to have issue with the bathroom setup -- I do n't see the problem , the shower wa large and the bathroom stall wa smallish . You 're only in their to take care of your business , how much room do you need ? As far a privacy in the bathroom -- you really should have those issue worked out long before you decide to room together . vanity , hairdryer , outlet in the bath area for iron , etc . and board in the closet . TV with plenty of station . Our maid wa okay , not terribly consistent with the time of day the room got cleaned . We had some chocolate and my husband 's Valentine 's Day card stolen , but we 're fairly certain that wa the man who fill the room fridge a that 's where the item were and the maid had cleaned prior to him coming in to . Luckily I had already most of the homemade chocolate . Hope he liked the card . Staff : friendly , friendly , friendly . Always willing to help you along with your Spanish or refresh a drink . These folk work day and night and still smile all the time . The Animation Team is awesome . We did water aerobics almost every day and felt great . We 're not the most energetic group and we take our relaxing VERY seriously , but this wa a lot of fun and what the heck , you 're in the water : we take an Immodium each morning and some and have never suffered from . We eat whatever we want and drink far too many combo of tropical drink . I guess you just have to know your . I bring bug lotion each year and have never needed it . For the last few hundred of u that still smoke ( bad , I know ) , the can be had at the Shop for $ 6 US . That 's about what we pay here in good ' New have several gift shop at the resort , but wait for Market night to do your shopping . A little and you can fare far better . It 's usually mid-week . Casino wa fairly big and lot of machine and a few table . I do n't gamble , but the member of our party who do said it wa fine . One guy even came back with more money than he went with ! Bring about $ 200 US single for tip . Couple of buck can go a long way with these folk . the wealth ! You 're on vacation for 's sake ! We tipped $ 5 per couple when we all went together to eat and that seemed to be very appreciated . We 'd tip a couple of buck with every drink order delivered too ( it wa always a tray full -- I mention we drink far too much ? ) and the waitress made sure we had whatever we needed for the entire week -- be it more ice or our stay and have already planned on returning to the Majestic next 'm sure I 've forgotten something , but if anyone ha question , feel free to contact anyone wa there between : we were the bunch of old folk with the near the swim-up bar . \n",
